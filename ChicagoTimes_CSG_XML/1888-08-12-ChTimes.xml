                    <p>The birthright of an American girl may be a glorious attribute on the deck of a trans-atlantic steamship or the floor of a <placeName>London</placeName> ball-room, but it is not worth the flop of a brass farthing in the cloak factories of <placeName>Chicago</placeName>.</p>
                    <p>It was high noon by the the <placeName>Jesuit college</placeName> clock when I got to the rear of <placeName>230 West Twelfth street</placeName>, where <persName>David Karasick</persName> has his shop. Nobody in but an old man. His face is seamed with wrinkles; he has a big nose the color and texture of a mushroom; his head and half his face is covered with hair of chinchilla shades; his back is humped at the shoulders and his clothes are filthy and worn. I ask for work and am told that no hands are needed. He has a pocket that hangs across his waist and into which he puts rags, pieces of thread, hooks and eyes, pins, buttons, and the empty spools that lie on the floor about the vacant machine-chairs. I watch the silent old man as he drags his loose slippers across the floor, and behold I have the key to wealth! But it doesn't profit me worth a copper. So I survey the premises.</p>
                    <p>One room, windows on three sides, and all shut. From the north windows I get a view of a two-story hen-house. Filth inside and out. The outlook from the east side is a picture of poverty, squalor, and filth. The buildings have no paint. In some are human beings, in others dumb brutes. Half-washed clothes dangle from window-sills and clothes-lines in tatters and rags. In the yards are heaps of manure and the alleys are foul-smelling and filthy. Along the street move flannel-shirted, horny-handed, sooty-faced men to smoke, to rest, to quarrel, and to dinner. Passing and re-passing all day long and every day&#8212;Sunday and Saturday&#8212;are yound women and old women, youths, maidens, and children, with as many cloaks or coats or pants as they can carry. The garbage boxes are reeking with filth. Some one has thrown ashes or sweep-ings<!-- 2016-02-27: nll: Dash maintained because it goes onto a separate line in the article.--> in the box and neither the swill man nor the ash man will remove the contents. <persName>Mayor Roche</persName> and <persName>Dr. DeWolf</persName>, equally ignorant of the manner in which their subordinates discharge their duty, per-mit<!-- 2016-02-27: nll: Again, dash maintained because it goes onto a separate line in the article.--> this sort of thing to go on till the very neighborhood is polluted and the air poisoned by these reeking masses of corruption.</p>
