In putting on <seg><w type="adj" subtype="poss" ana="#nellNelson">my</w> <w type="adj" ana="shop-girl">shop-girl</w> <w type="noun">disguise</w></seg> I had left <seg><w type="adj" subtype="poss" ana="#nellNelson">my</w> <w type="noun">purse</w></seg> at <w type="noun">home</w>. When the <w type="noun">conductor</w> asked for the <w type="noun">fair</w> I had <w type="noun">none</w> to give him. It was very hot, the <w type="noun">clouds</w> threatened <w type="noun">rain</w>, and the <w type="noun">shop</w> was at <seg><w type="adj" ana="great">so great</w> a <w type="noun">distance</w></seg> that I did not feel as if I could walk. I concluded to throw myself on the <w type="noun">generosity</w> of the <w type="noun">conductor</w> and told him I had forgotten <seg><w type="adj" subtype="poss" ana="#nellNelson">my</w> <w type="noun">purse</w></seg>. He looked ugly and told me to get off. Just as he placed <seg><w type="adj" subtype="poss">his</w> <w type="noun">whistle</w></seg> to <seg><w type="adj" subtype="poss">his</w> <w type="noun">lips</w></seg> to signal the <w type="noun">gripman</w> to stop a <seg><w type="adj" ana="distinguished">distinguished</w>, <w type="adj" ana="well-dressed">well-dressed</w> <w type="noun" ana="#benefactor">man</w></seg> paid <seg><w type="adj" subtype="poss" ana="#nellNelson">my</w> <w type="noun">fare</w></seg>. I thanked him for <seg><w type="adj" subtype="poss" ana="#benefactor">his</w> <w type="noun">courtesy</w></seg> and told him if he would give me <seg><w type="adj" subtype="poss" ana="#benefactor">his</w> <w type="noun">card</w></seg> I would send him the <w type="noun">money</w> he had so kindly paid.</p>
                    <p>He smiled and said: “<said who="#benefactor" ana="male">A <seg><w type="adj" ana="mere">mere</w> <w type="noun">bagatelle</w></seg> <w type="noun" ana="#nellNelson">miss</w>, and not <w type="adj" ana="worth">worth</w> mentioning.</said>"</p>
                    <p>At <placeName type="address">Eighteenth street</placeName> I left the <w type="noun">car</w> to go to a <seg><w type="adj" subtype="poss" ana="#employer">vestmaker’s</w> <w type="noun">place</w></seg> at <placeName type="address">2155 Archer avenue</placeName>.

Instead of raising <seg><w type="adj" subtype="poss">his</w> <w type="noun">hat</w></seg> he jauntily cocked <seg><w type="adj" subtype="poss" ana="#benefactor">his</w> <w type="adj" ana="left">left</w> <w type="noun">eye</w></seg> and came so close to me that the <w type="noun">sleeve</w> of <seg><w type="adj" subtype="poss" ana="#nellNelson">my</w> “<w type="adj" ana="never-rip">never-rip</w>” <w type="noun">jersey</w></seg> was pressed against the <w type="noun">waist-line</w> of <seg><w type="adj" subtype="poss" ana="#benefactor">his</w> <w type="adj" ana="light-gray">light-gray</w> <w type="noun">suit</w></seg>.</p>

    <p>“<said who="#benefactor" ana="male">Oh, you do, eh?</said>” in a tone that left no doubt that his stock in me had dropped. I wrote:</p>
    <p>Reporter.</p>
    <p>The Times.</p>
    <p>and handed it to <seg><w type="adj" subtype="subtype" ana="#nellNelson">my</w> <w type="noun">companion</w></seg>, who read it with <w type="noun">eyes</w> that seemed to have been wired open.

I looked after him, admiring the <w type="noun">cut</w> of <seg><w type="adj" subtype="poss" ana="#benefactor">his</w> <w type="noun">coat</w></seg>, the <w type="noun">swing</w> of <seg><w type="adj" subtype="poss" ana="#benefactor">his</w> <w type="noun">trousers</w></seg>, the <w type="noun">polish</w> of <seg><w type="adj" subtype="poss" ana="#benefactor">his</w> <w type="noun">shoes</w></seg>, and the <seg><w type="adj" ana="magnificent">magnificent</w> <w type="noun">carriage</w></seg> of <w type="noun">head</w> and <w type="noun">shoulders</w>, and thought:</p>

                    <p>When I reached the <w type="noun">shop</w> at <placeName type="address">2155 Archer avenue</placeName> the <w type="noun">tailor</w> told me he only wanted <seg><w type="adj" ana="one">one</w> <w type="noun">vestmaker</w></seg> and had hired her <seg><w type="adj" ana="two">two</w> <w type="noun">hours</w></seg> ago, I then went over on <placeName type="address">Cottage Grove avenue</placeName>, borrowed <seg><w type="adj" ana="twenty-five">25</w> <w type="noun">cents</w></seg> from <seg><w type="adj" subtype="poss" ana="#nellNelson">my</w> <w type="noun">dressmaker</w></seg> and rode down to <placeName type="address">Lake street</placeName> to get <w type="noun">work</w> in a <seg><w type="adj" ana="feather-duster">feather duster</w> <w type="noun">factory</w></seg>. There may have been <w type="noun">work</w>, but there was <seg><w type="adj" ana="non">no</w> <w type="noun">elevator</w></seg> and I was <seg><w type="adj" ana="too">too</w> <w type="noun">hot</w></seg> and tired to go up <seg><w type="adj" ana="five">five</w> <w type="noun">flights</w></seg> of <w type="noun">stairs</w> to look for it. I chose a <orgName ref="#cigarFactory">cigar factory</orgName> <placeName type="address">on Randolph near Dearborn street</placeName> with but <seg><w type="adj" ana="three">three</w> <w type="noun">pairs</w></seg> of <w type="noun">stairs</w> to climb and learned in the <w type="noun">salesroom</w> that they had all the <w type="noun">help</w> they needed. I tried <persName>Gomez</persName> across the <w type="noun">street</w>, who had <seg><w type="adj" ana="no">no</w> <w type="noun">work</w></seg>, but <seg><w type="adj" ana="enough">enough</w> <w type="noun">goodness</w></seg> of <w type="noun">heart</w> to give me a <w type="noun">chair</w> and a <w type="noun">letter</w> to <seg><w type="adj" ana="two">two</w> <w type="noun">cigarmakers</w></seg> of <seg><w type="adj" subtype="poss" ana="#employer">his</w> <w type="noun">nationality</w></seg>. I went to see <orgName type="exposedCompany" ref="#cigarFactory"><persName>F. Garcia</persName></orgName> at <placeName type="address" ref="#cigarFactory">20th Clark street</placeName>. He asked me if I could “strip” and I told him I could. When he wanted to know where I had worked I owned up that I didn’t know <w type="noun">anything</w> at all about the <w type="noun">business</w> but was anxious to learn and get <w type="noun">work</w>. He didn’t know “<said who="#employer" ana="male">how a <seg><w type="adj" ana="sewing">sewing</w> <w type="noun">girl</w></seg> would do at the ‘<w type="noun">fillers</w>’ but you might go and talk with <w type="noun">some</w> of the <w type="noun">help</w>, for you may not be <w type="adj" ana="satisfied">satisfied</w> to try even.</said>”</p>
                    <p>He showed me the <w type="noun">way</w> across the <w type="noun">hall</w> to an <seg><w type="adj" ana="empty">empty</w> <w type="noun">room</w></seg>. The <w type="noun">floor</w> was littered with <w type="noun">rags</w> and <w type="noun">paper</w> and the <w type="noun">dust</w> was <w type="adj" ana="heavy">heavy</w> on the <w type="noun">walls</w> and <w type="noun">wood-work</w> and in <seg><w type="adj" ana="one">one</w> <w type="noun">corner</w></seg> was a <seg><w type="adj" ana="sized">good-sized</w> <w type="noun">ash-pile</w></seg>. <persName>Garcia</persName> rapped for <w type="noun">entrance</w>, but there was so much <w type="noun">noise</w> within that the <w type="noun">door</w> remained fast. When the <w type="noun" ana="#employer">Spaniard</w> left me I turned the <w type="noun">knob</w> and came upon a <seg><w type="adj" ana="big">big</w> <w type="noun">boy</w></seg> who was tickling <seg><w type="adj" subtype="poss" ana="#employer">his</w> <w type="noun">laborers</w></seg>.

She told me she was the <seg><w type="adj" ana="old">oldest</w> <w type="noun">hand</w></seg> in the <w type="noun">shop</w>: that she could “strip” as fast as a <w type="noun">man</w>, and put the <seg><w type="adj" ana="ribbon">ribbon</w> <w type="noun">bands</w></seg> about the <w type="noun">cigars</w> before they were boxed.</p>
                    <p>At 12:15 o’clock I went into the <w type="noun">shop</w> and was given a <w type="noun">chair</w> in <w type="noun">front</w> of a <w type="noun">barrel</w> filled with <w type="noun">inches</w> of <w type="noun">tobacco</w> called “<w type="noun">hands</w>” and lined with <seg><w type="adj" ana="gunny">gunny</w>-<w type="noun">cloth</w></seg>. There was a <seg><w type="adj" ana="little">little</w> <w type="adj" ana="tin">tin</w> <w type="noun">pail</w></seg> of <seg><w type="adj" ana="brown">brown</w> <w type="noun">water</w></seg> for wetting I don’t know what near <seg><w type="adj" subtype="poss" ana="#nellNelson">my</w> <w type="noun">chair</w></seg>, and on the <seg><w type="adj" ana="other">other</w> <w type="noun">side</w></seg> a <seg><w type="adj" ana="pine">pine</w> <w type="noun">board</w> <w type="adj" ana="long">three feet long</w> and <w type="adj" ana="wide">sixteen inches wide</w></seg>. When the <seg><w type="adj" ana="tobacco">tobacco</w> <w type="noun">leaves</w></seg> were stripped and laid on the board it was thubbed a “book-filler” and carried off to the next room. In the shop with this were some eighteen men or more rolling the “fillers,” putting on the wrappers, shaping the <w type="noun">cigars</w> with a <seg><w type="adj">broad</w> <w type="noun">knife</w></seg> and seeming the <w type="noun">ends</w>. Along the <w type="noun">tables</w> <w type="noun">some</w> of the <w type="noun">men</w> were smoking and <w type="noun">others</w> chewing, <w type="noun">some</w> with <seg><w type="adj" subtype="poss" ana="#employee">their</w> <w type="noun">hats</w></seg> on and <w type="noun">all</w> in the <seg><w type="adj" ana="shirt">shirt</w>-<w type="noun">sleeves</w></seg>. There were <w type="noun">negroes</w>, <w type="noun">Swedes</w>, a <w type="noun">Chinaman</w>, <w type="noun">Germans</w>, and <w type="noun">Spaniards</w>, whose <w type="noun">influence</w> on the <w type="noun">lives</w> of the <seg><w type="adj" ana="young">young</w> <w type="noun" ana="#workingGirl">girls</w></seg>, while not really harmful, could hardly be called beneficial. I stripped leaves enough to enable me to take the social condition of the inmates, the bad light impure atmosphere,  the choking smell of the tobacco, and the photographs and prints cut from sensational papers that were tacked on the smoke-stained walls.</p>
    <p>From the cigar factory I went to the <orgName ref="#EUC" type="exposedCompany">Excelsior Underwear Company</orgName>, <placeName ref ="#EUC" type="address">199 and 201 Fifth avenue</placeName> and sat for half an hour while the forewoman scolded a pale-faced girl who wore mourning. She had brought back a dozen chemises for which the house paid $2, but the work was soiled in the making—machine oil having wet the cotton – and the forewoman refused to take it.</p>
    <p>“<said who="#workingGirl" ana="female">What shall I do?</said>” She asked the woman, with a voice as sad as her face.</p>
    <p>“<said who="#foreperson" ana="female">What does anybody do with dirty things? You will have to pay for laundering the garments of the greasy sewing and clean the thread.</said>”</p>
    <p>Then the girl was left alone by the manager, who went up to the other end of the counter to get trimmings for six dozen chemises that a tall young Swede girl was waiting for.The forewoman wore a blue dress of plaid design with a Marseilles vest buttoned in it, and of seven rings on her left hand six were set with what appeared to be diamonds. She had jewels at her chin and in her ears and hair. She measured off the lace edgings and the tape insertion and gave minute directions about the fullness and the finish. The six dozen garments were bundled up by <persName>Mr. Hyman</persName>, the proprietor, and the elevator carried her and her load to the pavement below. The seamstress told me she lived at home and with the help of her mother made $12 a week.</p>
    <p>“<said who="#workingGirl" ana="female">It is very hard work though,<rs type="interruption">” she said "</rs>We sew day and night. I had rather do it than work down in a shop for I have more self-respect. All the girls are not good, and very few are in a position to go with respectable people. They go with bad company and their language is bad. Sometimes in the winter they dance till daylight and go from the hall to the shop. I don’t blame them. The life of a girl who had nothing to depend on but her needle is a best a hard one. Still I don’t like to be with a crowd of factory girls if I can help it. The manager and superintendent obliged to be strict, but very seldom make any distinction in the treatment of a nice girl and one who is not so nice. I don’t think I can tell you how many ways there are to insult a girl. I have had a foreman just give me a look as I passed in to my machine or handed in my sewing that made me wish I was dead. Then there are the spiteful things the girls say about you and the cutting remarks of the forewoman that make you feel like fainting. The cashier may have a grudge and if he doesn’t hold your wages back till all the other hands are paid hell will throw it at you, make you take ragged bills, or give – ‘you a week’s pay in change.’  A cashier in a <placeName type="address">Jackson street</placeName> cravat factory once rubbed his hand across my chin “to feel my whiskers,” he said, and because I got angry and said I would report him he saved up all the silver that had holes and plugs and made me take it. My salary was $3.25 that week, and some of the silver couldn’t pass. I took it to a bank and the cashier was kind enough to give me good money for it. Plenty of times the forewoman has had me discharged for being “stuck up.</said>”</p>
    <p>Prices here range from 20 cents to $2 a dozen. It depends on the material. Children’s drawers pay 20 cents a dozen, but there are no button holes to work. Some shirts are $2 some $4 and some $1.70 but most of them only pay 20 cents. Everything is done by machine including button holes and gussets. The bosoms and bands are ready to go in. Corset-covers pay 40 cents and  20 cents each, but they have to be trimmed and the holes worked by hand. This is a mean shop, so far as prices go, but they are all alike in that particular. You have to find your own thread and you are constantly being suspected of keeping back short ends of trimmings.</p>
    <p>I asked the forewoman for stitching and was given shirts at 80 cents a dozen to do. I had to pay 50 cents for the use of the machine and 25 cents for a spindle of thread. I told the forewoman I had left my purse at home, but she said it was “<said who="#foreperson" ana="female">alright you can have it taken out of your wages.</said>" I asked her what the machine cost, but she doesn’t know, and when I ventured that the  expiration of the patient had reduced the old place $15 to about $12 she told me she “<said who="#foreperson" ana="female">reckoned I didn’t know what I was talking about.</said>” The room where we worked was about eighteen feet wide and ten feet deep with toilet closets built out from the walls. The machines encircled the three walls and in the middle of the floor were the boxes of work. One girl was stitching wrist-bands, another had button-hole machine and was getting 50 cents a hundred. A third was making tucked drawers at 20 cents a dozen and I had a shirt at 60 cents which I failed to finish all three hours, being unable to manage a machine.</p>
