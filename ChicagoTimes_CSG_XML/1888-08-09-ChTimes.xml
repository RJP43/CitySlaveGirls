                        <p>It was 7 a.m. by all the whistles in "<placeName>Little Hell</placeName>" when I reached that section of the city in search of an opening in a <w type="noun">slop-shop</w>. The <w type="noun">streets</w> were crowded with <w type="noun">shop</w> <w type="noun">hands</w> hurrying to their day's work-men and boys with pipes in their mouths carrying dinner-pails or lunch-baskets; <seg><w type="adj" ana="little">little</w> <w type="noun">girls</w></seg> in groups of two and three in <seg><w type="adj" ana="beggarly">beggarly</w> <w type="noun">rags</w></seg>; <seg><w type="adj" ana="young">young</w> <w type="noun" ana="#workingGirl">women</w></seg> and <seg><w type="adj" ana="old">old</w> <w type="noun" ana="#workingGirl">women</w></seg>, some of <seg><w type="noun" ana="#workingGirl">them</w> <w type="adj" ana="whiteHaired">white-haired</w> and <w type="adj" ana="stooped">stooped</w></seg> with age, wearing <w type="noun">shawls</w> about their <w type="noun">heads</w> and shoulders and the meanest apologies for shoes. Many <seg><w type="noun" ana="#workingGirl">girls</w> were <w type="adj" ana="bareHeaded">bare-headed</w></seg>, and some went through the streets in <seg><w type="adj" ana="old">old</w> <w type="noun" ana="skirts">skirts</w></seg> and <seg><w type="adj" ana="dilapidated">dilapidated</w> <w type="noun" ana="waist">waists</w></seg> that had neither collar nor sleeves.</p>
                        <p>At the corner of <placeName>Elm and Wesson streets</placeName> is an <seg><w type="adj" ana="immense">immense</w> <seg><w type="adj" ana="tailor">tailor</w> <w type="noun">shop</w></seg></seg> into which the <w type="noun" ana="#workingGirl">girls</w> fairly swarmed, some going into the main and some into the rear <w type="noun">building</w>. Both <w type="noun">buildings</w> have three <w type="noun">stories</w>, each containing a <w type="noun">shop</w> under a different "boss." I followed the <w type="noun">crowd</w> through both <w type="noun">buildings</w> beginning in the basement and going up and up and up the <seg><w type="adj" ana="narrow">narrow</w>, <w type="adj" ana="dirty">dirty</w>, covered <w type="noun">stairs</w></seg>, stopping on each <w type="noun">floor</w> to see the "<w type="noun" ana="employer">boss</w>" and apply for work. No success. The <seg><w type="adj" ana="vest">vest</w> <w type="noun">shops</w></seg> were full and so were the <seg><w type="adj" ana="trouser">trousers</w> <w type="noun">shops</w></seg>. In the <w type="noun">jacket</w> <w type="noun">shop</w> there was room for experienced hands only at the <seg><w type="adj" ana="munificent">munificent</w> <w type="noun">salary</w></seg> of $3 a week. The garments were cut and the sewer had the entire making.</p>
                        <p>As I passed through the <seg><w type="adj">crowded</w> <w type="noun">rooms</w></seg> I could not help noticing the machine-like way in which everything was done. Not a moment was wasted in greetings or exchange of friendly remarks. Almost at the very instant the <w type="noun" ana="#workingGirl">girls</w> took their <w type="noun">seats</w> the <w type="noun">machines</w> were whizzing and whirling and the bright <seg><w type="adj" ana="little">little</w> <w type="noun">needles</w></seg> flying through <w type="noun">seams</w>, <w type="noun">collars</w>, <w type="noun">bands</w>, and <w type="noun">facings</w>. <w type="noun">Cutters</w> clicked their <w type="noun">shears</w> and <seg><w type="adj">little</w> <w type="noun">scissors</w></seg> and pressers sponged <w type="noun">leg-seams</w> and <w type="noun">collars</w> and moved their heavy "<w type="noun">gooses</w>" under <seg><w type="adj" ana="little">little</w> <w type="noun">clouds</w></seg> of steaming <w type="noun">vapor</w>. Everywhere it was work, work, work, for barely enough to keep life in the body and virtue in the soul of these <seg><w type="adj" ana="hapless">hapless</w> <w type="noun" ana="#workingGirl">children</w></seg> of misery.</p>
                        <p>The only real misery about these two <seg><w type="adj" ana="great">great</w> <w type="noun">shops</w></seg>, containing in all about <damage agent="fold" unit="word" quantity="1"/><unclear/> <w type="noun">work-rooms</w> and <seg><w type="adj" ana="five">five</w> <w type="noun">hundred</w></seg> <w type="noun" ana="#workingGirl">workers</w>, was the wealth of sunlight and fresh air. On three sides of the <w type="noun">buildings</w> were <w type="noun">windows</w> through which the heavens smiled. The <w type="noun">staircases</w>, which, by the way, were boxed, ran aling the right side of the <w type="noun">building</w>, and which, in case of <w type="noun">fire</w>, whould have gone up in an instant, leaving the <seg><w type="adj">unfortunate</w> <w type="noun">inmates</w></seg> with absolutely no means of escape but the <w type="noun">windows</w>. I asked one of the "<w type="noun" ana="employer">bosses</w>" where his <w type="noun">fire-escape</w> was, and he told me if I has no other business with him to "<said who="employer" ana="male">get out.</said>"</p>
                        <p>All the <w type="noun" ana="#workingGirl">women</w> and <w type="noun" ana="#workingGirl">girls</w> I talked with lived at <w type="noun">home</w>. I was informed that only those living in the <w type="noun">neighborhood</w> were engaged, thus doing away with the car-fare item. Some of the <seg><w type="adj">little</w> <w type="noun">girls</w></seg> were paid $1 a week for tacking on <w type="noun">tickets</w>, sewing on buckles to <w type="noun">backstraps</w>, and pulling out basting stitches. All other work was paid for by the piece and salaries varying from $2 to $10, according to the skill of the laborer. $4 being a fair average for this season of the year. The worst feature of these <w type="noun">shops</w> was the limited <w type="noun">room</w>. The <w type="noun" ana="#workingGirl">girls</w> sat <w type="noun">elbow</w> to <w type="noun">elbow</w> and the <w type="noun">floor</w> was piled with work half an hour after the <w type="noun">shop</w> opened.</p>
                        <p>At 8 o'clock I went to <orgName type="exposedCompany" ref="#BS">Benson's shop</orgName> at <placeName type="address" ref="#BS">Hobbie and Chatham streets</placeName> where some evidences of decency were apparent. Instead of the rude <w type="noun">timber</w> generally put in work <w type="noun">tables</w> I found those on the main <w type="noun">floor</w> planed and grained. Off the shop was a <seg><w type="adj" ana="cozy">cozy</w> <w type="adj" ana="little">little</w> <w type="noun">office</w></seg>, and printed in three different languages were framed <w type="noun">copies</w> of rules and regulations. Quoting from the set, the employes were notified that the hours of work were from 7 to 12 and from 1 to 6; any one desiring to leave before would require a <w type="noun">permit</w> to do so from the office; any one neglecting to give the firm a "three days' notice prior to leaving would forfeit any salary due; every operator was obliged to oil and clean her <w type="noun">machine</w> in the morning before using and in the evening after using it.</p>
                        <p>The prices paid were miserably low. A couple of <w type="noun" ana="#workingGirl">girls</w> who "tacked" <w type="noun">pockets</w> recieved <seg><w type="adj" ana="eighty">80</w> <w type="noun">cents</w></seg> a hundred, and work was kept back so that often the earnings did not exceed $2 a week. Once or twice $18 was recieved in two weeks. <w type="noun" ana="#workingGirl">Girls</w> who did the "flesh" basting along the <seg><w type="noun">leg</w> <w type="noun">seams</w> of <w type="noun">pants</w></seg> were paid $1 a hundred; 7 cents was the price paid for finishing the cheaper vesta and 9 cents the better ones. Here I met <seg><w type="adj" ana="whiteHaired">white-haired</w> <w type="noun" ana="workigGirl">women</w></seg> who sewed from morning till night to make $5 a week.</p>
                        <p>The "<w type="noun" ana="#employer">boss</w>" didn't need any help, so I tried the <seg><w type="adj" ana="retail">retail</w> <w type="adj">tailor</w> <w type="noun">store</w></seg> of <orgName type="exposedCompany" ref="#KNels">Knute Nelson</orgName>, <placeName type="address" ref="#KNels">113 Chicago avenue</placeName>.</p>
                        <p>"<said who="#employer" ana="male"><seg><w type="noun">Business</w> is <w type="adj" ana="dull">dull</w></seg> and we are not doing much <w type="noun">up-stairs</w>. You might come in next <w type="noun">week</w> if you are idle, but I'll tell you now that you can't earn over <seg><w type="adj" ana="fifty">50</w> cents</seg> a day. We are working on <w type="noun">vests</w>; make them all by <w type="noun">machine</w>. If you can sew well I'll give you 1 cent for joining the collar.</said>"</p>
                        <p>Telling him he would do nothing of the kind I put into <placeName>Cleveland avenue</placeName> and came upon the genuine <w type="noun">slop-shop</w>. At <placeName type="address" ref="#Schmidt">No. 314</placeName> I met <orgName type="exposedCompany" ref="#Schmidt"><persName>Mrs. Schmidt</persName></orgName>. The family lives up-stairs in a <w type="noun">cottage</w> and on the ground floor is the <w type="noun">shop</w>, which is entered from the back yard via the kitchen.</p>
                        <p>In the latter <seg><w type="noun">apartment</w> was a <w type="adj" ana="splendid">splendid</w>, <w type="adj" ana="big">big</w> <w type="noun">range</w>, <w type="adj" ana="brightlyPolished">brightly polished</w></seg>. A couple of Sweded were pressing at a side <w type="noun">table</w>. In the front <w type="noun">room</w> were the <seg><w type="noun">machine</w> <w type="noun" ana="#workingGirl">girls</w>, <w type="adj" ana="nice">nice</w>, <w type="adj" ana="healthy">healthy</w> <w type="noun">creatures</w></seg>, selected no doubt for their enduring quality. Nothing but the <w type="noun">boards</w> in the <w type="noun">floor</w> protected the place from the <seg><w type="adj" ana="damp">damp</w> <w type="noun">soil</w></seg>, and while everything was scrupulously <w type="adj" ana="neat">neat</w> the <w type="noun">facilities</w> for rheumatism were largely <w type="adj" ana="superior">superior</w> to those for <w type="noun">health</w>, <w type="noun">comfort</w>, and <w type="noun">light</w>. <w type="noun">Wages</w> varied. <persName>Mr Schmidt</persName> was away but his salary sheet was safe in his wife's keeping. "<said who="#employer" ana="female">Some <w type="noun" ana="#workingGirl">girls</w> care so much and some not so much, and that's how it is,</said>" she said. One of her <seg><w type="adj" ana="old">oldest</w> <w type="noun" ana="#workingGirl">hands</w></seg> told me she worked "<said who="#workingGirl" ana="female">like a slave for $4.50 and never get more than $5. He won't let you.</said>"</p>
                        <p><persName>Mr. Huber</persName> of <placeName type="address">335 Cleveland avenue</placeName> has not mastered the <seg><w type="adj" ana="english">English</w> <w type="noun">language</w></seg>, but knows all about the values of <seg><w type="adj" ana="american">American</w> <w type="noun">labor</w></seg>, since he gets it as low as <seg><w type="noun">$</w><w type="adj" ana="1">1</w></seg> a <w type="noun">week</w>.</p>
                        <p>His <w type="noun">establishment</w> is in a rear <w type="noun">building</w> adjoining his <w type="noun">residence</w>. Ascending a <seg><w type="noun">flight</w> of <w type="adj" ana="wood">wooden</w> <w type="noun">stairs</w></seg> I found myself on a <w type="noun">landing</w>, from which one <w type="noun">door</w> led to the Huber <w type="noun">kitchen</w> and another down four <w type="noun">steps</w> to the <w type="noun">shop</w>. The <w type="noun" ana="#workingGirl">sewers</w> numbered possibly thirty, in all stages of poverty. The worked as though salvation depended on industry, and all the time I remained not a word was spoken. The <w type="noun" ana="#workingGirl">girls</w> made signs when a <w type="noun">spool</w> of <w type="noun">thread</w> or a <w type="noun">skein</w> of <w type="noun">twist</w> was wanted. From every <w type="noun">window</w> a different <w type="noun">house</w> was visible, some of them, being nothing more than <w type="noun">sheds</w>, in all of which were <seg><w type="adj" ana="young">young</w> <w type="noun" ana="children">children</w> and <w type="noun" ana="mothers">mothers</w></seg>.</p>
                        <p><persName>Huber</persName> didn't want any more help. I sought him through his wife, but found him so sullen out of pity for her I took an <seg><w type="adj" ana="early">early</w> <w type="noun">dismissal</w></seg>. It made me very unhappy to see the <seg><w type="adj" ana="poor">poor</w> <w type="noun" ana="#workingGirl">girls</w></seg> slaving over their work, ruining their <w type="noun">eyes</w>, <w type="noun">health</w>, and <w type="noun">appearance</w> by the <seg><w type="adj" ana="faulty">faulty</w> <w type="noun">positions</w></seg> in which they sat. It needed no quizzing to learn that the <seg><w type="noun">salaries</w> recieved were <w type="adj" ana="poor">poor</w></seg>, for there was not a <seg><w type="adj" ana="decent">decent</w> pair of <w type="noun">shoes</w></seg> nor a <seg><w type="adj" ana="tidy">tidy</w> <w type="noun">dress</w></seg> in the whole assembly.</p>
                        <p>In the rear of <placeName type="address">323 Cleaveland avenue</placeName> is a <seg><w type="adj" ana="twoStory">two-story</w> <w type="adj" ana="wood">wood</w> <w type="noun" ana="shed">shed</w></seg>, on the upper <w type="noun">floor</w> of which <persName>Herr Klein</persName> and a half a hundred <w type="noun" ana="#employee">employes</w> work on "shop" <w type="noun">clothing</w> and make <w type="noun">money</w>. That is, <persName>Klein</persName> makes it. At the foot of the stairs leading from the back-yard is a <seg><w type="adj">little</w> <w type="noun">kennel</w></seg>, from which a <seg><w type="adj" ana="ferocious">ferocious</w> <w type="noun" ana="watchDog">watch-dog</w></seg> bounded and scared me into a fit. The "boss" was "<said who="foreman" ana="male">out on the front <w type="noun">sidewalk</w></said>" the <w type="noun" ana="foreman">foreman</w> told me. He offered to call him, but I protested and, seating myself on the edge of a <w type="noun">press-stand</w>, surveyed the <w type="noun">room</w>. <w type="noun" ana="#workingGirl">Gorls</w> all around sewing with <seg><w type="adj" ana="slavish">slavish</w> <w type="noun">speed</w></seg> and <seg><w type="adj" ana="convict">convict</w> <w type="noun">silence</w></seg>. Everything <w type="adj" ana="silent">silent</w> as the <w type="noun">tomb</w> but the trembling <w type="noun">machines</w>. <seg><w type="noun" ana="#workingGirl">Girls</w> in <w type="adj" ana="calico">calico</w> <w type="noun">rags</w> and <w type="adj" ana="woolen">woolen</w> <w type="noun">rags</w></seg> and <seg><w type="noun" ana="#workingGirl">one</w> with a <w type="adj" ana="neat">neat</w> <w type="adj" ana="little">little</w> <w type="adj" ana="3Cent">3-cent</w> <w type="adj" ana="cotton">cotton</w> <w type="noun">suit</w> and a <w type="adj">pink</w> <w type="noun">ribbin</w> about her <w type="noun">neck</w></seg>. A <w type="noun" ana="child">child</w> of a dozen years or so goes round the <w type="noun">room</w> with <w type="noun">drinking-water</w>. The four <seg><w type="noun">men</w> wear <w type="noun">slippers</w> and <w type="adj">clay</w> <w type="noun">pipes</w></seg> and press without ceasing the <seg><w type="adj" ana="cheap">cheap</w> <w type="adj" ana="John">John</w> and <w type="adj">cottony</w> <w type="noun">pants</w> and <w type="noun">vests</w></seg>. All the <w type="noun">windows</w> are wide open and at the very level of their sills I count the <w type="noun">roofs</w> of seven foul-smelling <w type="noun">closets</w>.</p>
                        <p><persName>Klein</persName> is <w type="adj">middle-aged</w>, with a <seg><w type="noun">complaxion</w> like <w type="noun">pork</w> <w type="noun">tenderloin</w></seg> and a limited knowlege of English. He manages to make me understand that I have no show, and I make my farewell appearance and open at <orgName type="exposedCmpany" ref="#Schmall">Schmallen's</orgName> <placeName type="address" ref="#Schmall">138 Mohawk street</placeName>. That <w type="noun" ana="#employer">gentleman</w> uses his <w type="noun" ana="#forewoman">wife</w> for a <w type="noun">mouthpiece</w> and his <w type="noun">kitchen</w> for a <w type="noun">factory</w>. Only three <w type="noun" ana="#workingGirl">girls</w> are at work. Rest laid off till next week. They have <w type="noun">pantaloons</w> for the millions about the <w type="noun">room</w>, stacked in <w type="noun">piles</w> of five feet high, for finishing which <w type="noun" ana="workigGirl">girls</w> get 6 cents or 30 cents a day.</p>
                        <p>At <placeName type="address">26 Eugenie street</placeName> I find another <w type="noun">shop</w> in which the <w type="noun" ana="#workingGirl">girls</w> are packed like <w type="noun">cattle</w> in a <w type="noun">freight car</w>. The "<w type="noun" ana="#employee">boss</w>" doesn't want to try me and I'm glad of it.</p>
                        <p>I take a walk down <placeName>Larrabee street</placeName>. At <orgName type="exposedCompany" ref="#Olson">Olson's</orgName>, on <placeName>Sedgwick street near Superior</placeName>, I am "taken." It is just 12 o'clock. I have been tramping through "<placeName>Little Hell</placeName>" and vicinity since 7 o'clock and feel complately "done." I take a rest till 12:30 and explore the <w type="noun">shop</w>. The <w type="noun">building</w> is a story and a half, extending back to the <w type="noun">alley</w>, with a frontage of forty feet. In the <seg><w type="noun">basement</w> is a <w type="adj">livery</w> <w type="noun">stable</w></seg>. <persName>Mr. Olsen</persName> keeps three or more <w type="noun">steeds</w> here and rents out a <w type="noun">stall</w> or two to a <w type="noun">neighbor</w>. Off the <w type="noun">stable</w> is a <w type="noun">closet</w> for the <w type="noun" ana="employee">hands</w> On the <w type="noun">floor</w> above the <w type="noun">stables</w> are <w type="noun">quarters</w> for twenty odd <w type="noun" ana="employee">men</w> ans <w type="noun" ana="#workingGirl">women</w> in a <seg><w type="adj" ana="dirty">dirty</w>, <w type="adj" ana="dark">dark</w>, <w type="adj" ana="gloomy">gloomy</w> <w type="noun">place</w></seg>, with <seg><w type="adj" ana="bare">bare</w> <w type="noun">rafters</w></seg> and <seg><w type="adj" ana="smokeStained">smoke-stained</w>, <w type="adj" ana="unfinished">unfinished</w> <w type="noun">walls</w></seg>. The <w type="noun">machine-tables</w> are set along the <w type="noun">window</w> line, leaving the center of the <w type="noun">floor</w> for a blazing <w type="noun">furnace</w> that supplies the <w type="noun">power</w> and <w type="noun">mountains</w> of <w type="noun">pants</w> ready to be finished. Near the roaring <w type="noun" ana="fire">fire</w> is a <w type="noun">sink</w> supplied with nothing but a <w type="noun">faucet</w>. When it was time to go <w type="noun">home</w> my <w type="noun">face</w> and <w type="noun">hands</w> were coated with <w type="noun">dust</w> and <w type="noun">dye</w>, but there was neither <w type="noun">soap</w> nor <w type="noun">towel</w> with which to make myself decent and I had to go unwashed. The upper <w type="noun">floor</w> had a slanting <w type="noun">roof</w> in which <w type="noun">windows</w> were cut to admit the necessary although by no means <seg><w type="adj">sufficient</w> <w type="noun">light</w></seg>. The <w type="noun">heat</w> was simply enfeebling. Before I had half started my <w type="noun">No. 33</w> I was inclined to throw down the <w type="noun">gauntlet</w> and go <w type="noun">home</w>, but the <seg><w type="adj">patient</w>, uncomplaining, suffering <w type="noun" ana="#workingGirl">girls</w></seg> made me ashamed of myself and I resolved to hold on. The <w type="noun">perspiration</w> rolled down their <w type="noun">arms</w> and <w type="noun">faces</w> and stained the <seg><w type="adj">miserable</w> <w type="noun">waists</w></seg> they wore at the <w type="noun">neck</w> and <w type="noun">shoulders</w>.</p>
                        <p>"<said who="#workingGirl" ana="female">Yes, it's awful hot up here," <rs type="interruption">my neighbor remarked,</rs> "but this is nothing to the cold. In the <w type="noun">winter</w> we work with out <w type="noun">cloaks</w> on always till <w type="noun">noon</w>, and lots of times I have kept my <w type="noun">overshoes</w> on all day.</said>"</p>
                        <p>The "<w type="noun" ana="#employer">boss</w>" made me equivocate about my knowledge of the <w type="noun">pantaloon</w> trade.</p>
                        <p>"I can't take any but <seg><w type="adj" ana="experienced">experienced</w> <w type="noun">help</w></seg>."</p>
                        <p>"<said who="#nellNelson" ana="female">How much?</said>"</p>
                        <p>"<said who="#employer" ana="male">Where have you worked?</said>"</p>
                        <p>"Oh, at <orgName type="exposedCompany" ref="#Gold">Goldsmith's</orgName> and <orgName type="exposedCompany" ref="#Stein">Julins Stein's</orgName> and <orgName type="exposedCompany" ref="#Ellinger">Ellinger's</orgName> and--"</p>
                        <p>"<said who="#employer" ana="male">Have you done tailoring?</said>"</p>
                        <p>"<said who="#nellNelson" ana="female">Plenty.</said>"</p>
                        <p>"<said who="#employer" ana="male">Well, then, if you're experienced you ought to be worth considerable: Here, take that for a sample,</said>" and he handed me a <w type="noun">pair</w> of <seg><w type="adj">No. 33</w> <w type="adj" ana="striped">striped</w> <w type="noun">pantaloons</w></seg> with a <seg><w type="noun">roll</w> of <w type="adj" ana="red">red</w> and <w type="adj" ana="white">white</w> <w type="noun">waistbands</w></seg> and sent me up-stairs, where, between the <w type="noun">stable</w> smell and the evervating atmosphere, I became near collapsing.</p>
                        <p>I hadn't the faintest idea of how to go about the <w type="noun">waist</w> of the <w type="noun">garment</w>, but I watched the "<w type="noun">boss</w>" down-stairs and got <persName>Matson</persName> to let me sit by him. The dear <seg><w type="noun" ana="#employee">man</w> was <w type="adj" ana="bald">bald</w> and <w type="adj" ana="untidy">untidy</w></seg>, but he basted in the body lining for me, chalked the <w type="noun">buttons</w> on the <w type="noun">waistband</w> and <w type="noun">fly</w>, and did my ripping--which was not trifling. It was 12:30 o'clock when I began, and I worked every moment of the time with a diligence that was positively criminal till the work was done. It was 4:45 o'clock when I handed my first pair of factory <w type="noun">trousers</w> to the "<w type="noun" ana="employer">boss</w>," who looked them over from <w type="noun">bottoms</w> to <w type="noun">buttons</w>, and said: "<said who="employer" ana="male">You'll do the others better.</said>"</p>
                        <p>"<said who="#nellNelson" ana="female">Yes, sir. How much?</said>"</p>
                        <p>"<said who="#employer" ana="male"><seg><w type="adj" ana="5">Five</w> <w type="noun">cents</w></seg>.</said>"</p>
                        <p>How is that for American labor? <seg><w type="adj" ana="5">Five</w> <w type="noun">cents</w></seg> for <seg><w type="adj" ana="4">four</w> <w type="noun">hours</w></seg>' work!</p>
                        <p>I was told by the <w type="noun" ana="#workingGirl">women</w> who take them <w type="noun">home</w> that <seg><w type="adj" ana="4">four</w> <w type="noun">pair</w></seg> are as many as they can finish in a <w type="noun">day</w>. That is <seg><w type="adj">20</w> <w type="noun">cents</w></seg>, or <seg><w type="noun">$</w><w type="adj" ana="1.2">1.20</w></seg> a week. But, oh, the smell of that <w type="noun">cellar</w> <w type="noun">stable</w> and the heat and the <seg><w type="adj" ana="wan">wan</w> <w type="noun" ana="face">faces</w> of the <w type="noun" ana="#workingGirl">girls</w></seg> that make hideous the very name of Olson.</p>
