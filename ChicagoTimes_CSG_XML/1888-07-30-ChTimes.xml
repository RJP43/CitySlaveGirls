    <date when="1888-07-10">Tuesday, July 10</date>, according to instructions from <ref type="theTimes">THE
            TIMES</ref>, I made up for the role of shop-girl, and with a
        list of factories in one hand and gentle peace in the other sailed down <desc type="location">State
            street</desc> under a brown braise veil as impenetrable as an iron mask. I applied
        at two <ref type="industry">feather factories</ref> and three <ref type="industry">corset shops</ref>, but aside from the exercise up and down
        several flights of stairs got nothing. The feather people did not need any help and the
        corset folks had not started on the winter trade. I was treated with civility, however, and
        given permission to “drop in a week or so.” The fifth place on my list was the
            <orgName type="exposedCompany">“Western Lace Manufacturing Co.”</orgName> <desc type="location">218 State street</desc>. Ascending one
        flight of stairs I stopped to take off my veil and adjust my eyes to the low light. That
        done I looked about and finding a door marked ”Office of the <orgName type="exposedCompany">Western Lace
            Manufacturing Co.</orgName>” with “Come In” on the glass I complied. A young girl
        followed and leaving her to close the door I fell into a chair, the only one about, and
        proceeded to perspire and scrutinize the place. The
            office was not uninviting. The flow had a cheap carpet, the ceiling was high and the
            room well ventilated and admirable lighted. On a long table, that
        served as a sort of fortification for the private office of the company, were the
        samples—“antique crocheted good”—as they are listed, in various shades of white. All were of
        different pattern and unvarying ugliness. There were round tidies and oblong tidies, square
        mats for a bureau and smaller ones of oval and circular design, intended for a lamp or
        cushion. Behind the table, sachetiny between a writing stand and a desk, was a young man of
        30 or so, of blonde type, with a stationary scowl between his eyebrows and <unclear/>
        otherwise pleasing manner. That is, I thought the manner pleasing till I began to get
        acquainted with it and then my opinion changed. After a lapse of five minutes or so the
        fair-haired gentlemen turned to the young girl with a deepening of the <unclear/> and a most
        unalluring “Well?”.<unclear/> “I brought the mate back.” “Oh, you have, eh?” opening a piece
        of newspaper and unfolding a dozen hand-made mats the size of a tea-plate. The work is
        carefully examined on both sides and as he proceeds the scowl deepens. Without a word he
        tosses the lot on the little table and reaches for the proffered black the girl had opened.
        “What’s your name?” “<persName>Rhafferty</persName>.” “How do you spell it?”
        “R-h-a-f-f-e-r-t-y.” “Oh, yes; <persName>Martha Rhafferty</persName>,” after hunting through
        a long list. “Do you want more work?” “No, sir.” “There’s plenty more if you want it.” “No;
        my mother don’t want me to do any more <ref type="occupation">crocheting</ref>. “Well, <persName>Mr. White</persName>
        isn’t in now. Can’t you come in again?” No answer. A look of discouragement comes over the
        young face. “Don’t you have to do any shopping about town?” “No, sir.” “Well, you can wait,
        can’t you? Wait here. Take a chair. (I had the only one.) Just go in the next room there and
        take a chair. As he went to lead the way the crochet-teacher called his attention, and the
        girl remaining I seized my chances for a bit of interviewing. <persName>Martha</persName> showed me her contract,
        in which <desc type="wageDesc">the firm agreed to refund $1 of the $3 deposited when she had finished $15 worth of
        work</desc>. On the back of the contract were the credit receipts of the company entered in lead
        pencil, dating from <date when="--01">January</date> to <date when="--07">July</date>. She told me she lived in <placeName>Gross Park</placeName>, away out on the
        <desc type="location">West side</desc> that <desc type="workingClass">she helped her mother, and had been trying to earn <num type="wage" value="15.00">$15</num> since <date when="--01">January</date></desc>. She
        received <desc type="wageDesc"><num type="wage" value=".60">60 cents</num> a dozen for the mats and it took her a week to crochet a dozen</desc>. “Then I
        must pay 10 cents car fare each time, and that leaves only <num type="wage" value=".40">40 cents</num>. I had to pay $3 before I
        could get any work. I always knew how to crochet, but they made me pay $2 for lessons and $1
        as a security. I began in <date when="--01">January</date>, the first week, and now I am through. <desc type="wageDesc">I have made <num type="wage" value="15.00">$15</num>,
        and when they give me back the dollar I shall have <num type="wage" value="16.00">$16</num>.</desc>” Here is a company paying a girl of
        18 $15 for six months and one week’s labor. When <persName>Mr. Ford</persName> came from the
        work-room he was met by a boy who had brought in some work and was in a hurry to be off.
            “<persName>Mrs. Clark</persName> sent these mats and she, wants you to receipt for
        them.” The paper is opened and the work inspected. The scowl deepens. There will be trouble
        and I prick up my ears. “I don’t like this. This is bad. They are all stained. Are you
        her—her—are you a relation?” “Yes.” “Well, you must tell her to wash her hands. These goods
        are all sweet. I’ll have to charge her for spoilage the material if it occurs again. Did she
        tell you to ask for more work?” “No, sir.” The poor boy is gone. <persName>Martha</persName> sits in the back
        room the picture of <unclear/> and the entry being made I am approached.
            <desc type="middleClass">I look like a beggar and that is what I am taken for, as, the pretty
            blonde secretary only scowls.</desc> He stands and looks down at me and I
        sit and look up at him waiting for the, lines in the handsome brow to deepen, the edge of
        the soft, brown mustache to curl, and the laconic, withering “well” to break the gaze. It
        comes. “Have you any work?” I ask. “Plenty.” Do you want work?” “Yes.” “What can you do?”
        “Oh, I can crochet.” “This kind of work?” handing over one of the 60-cent mats. “Yes; what
        do you pay?” “Different prices. Pay by the dozen, from <num type="wage" value=".60">60 cents</num> to <num type="wage" value="10.00">$10</num>.” “Let me have a
        dozen of the $10 kind, please,giving my cat-colored eyes a mater doloroso sort

              As he caught the seraphic expression some facial machinery gave a lurch that threw on side
        of his countenance bias for a second. Reaching to the desk he pulled out the following
        circular and handed it to me. <orgName type="exposedCompany">OFFICE OF WESTERN LACE MANUFACTURING CO.
                (Incorporated)</orgName>, <desc type="location">218 STATE STREET, CHICAGO,
            ILL</desc>—<unclear/>: In reply to your letter regarding the work we send
        out to ladies to do at their homes we beg to say that we make a large line of crochet goods
        of our antique crochet cotton a sample of which you will find enclosed, also linen, silk,
        etc. We make <ref type="factoryItem">mats</ref>, <ref type="factoryItem">tidies</ref>, <ref type="factoryItem">lambrequins</ref>, <ref type="factoryItem">bedspreads</ref>, <ref type="factoryItem">shams</ref>, <ref type="factoryItem">collars</ref>, <ref type="factoryItem">hood</ref>, <ref type="factoryItem">lace edging</ref>, etc.,
        in large quantities. We have been established here for the last five years and have extra
        facilities for selling goods in large lost: so we are enabled to keep our workers in steady
        work all the time. Should you desire to work for us we should be pleased to send you work on
        the following terms: When you send order for work you are required to remit to us $3: $2 of
        this is to pay us for the patterns and instructions which we shall send you with each lot of
        new work. We shall also send you sufficient extra material so you can make a sample of each
        pattern sent, which you are allowed to keep for yourself; $1 of the $3 you send is a deposit
        on the material we send, and this we shall return to you at any time when you return the
        work and wish to stop. You will be kept in steady work, paid for each lot when made and
        re-turned to us in good order. <desc type="wageDesc">Our work is all made by the dozen, and prices range from <num type="wage" value=".50">50
        cents</num> per dozen to <num type="wage" value="10.00">$10</num> per dozen, according to amount of work. An easy pattern, with sample
        and full instructions, will be sent you at first, and the quality of work, and advance in
        prices as you adapt yourself to do-ing it. The work will be sent you by mail, post-age paid
        by us one way. Three month’s time is allowed you to do any one dozen of articles we send.</desc>
        This enables ladies who have only a few hours daily to spare to do our work as well as those
        ladies who take it intending to do it steadily. We are asked many times how much a lady can
        earn. This depends entirely upon your ability to crochet and the time you have at your
        command daily; ladies earning from <num type="wage" value="2.00">$2</num> to <num type="wage" value="3.00">$3</num> weekly. We could not guarantee to anyone any
        stated amount that they could earn, but our work is easy and after you accustom yourself to
        it you can do it very rapidly. If you desire work for us fill out the blank be-low and
        return it to us with the $3, and we will place your name on our books and send work at once
        with full instructions. Send your money by post-office order, draft, payable to our order,
        or registered letter at our risk. Very Truly, <orgName type="exposedCompany">WESTERN LACE MANUFACTURING
            CO.</orgName> Keep the above for future reference. …………………………………………………… …………………..188

                STREET, CHICAGO, Ill.</desc>—Gentlemen: In-closed find $3 that I send
        you to secure patterns, instructions, and material for crochet work; $2 is to pay you for
        samples and instructions, and $1 is for deposit on material which I shall demand returned to
        me at any time when I return to you the material in my hands. Signature………………………………………….
        Town……………………………………………… County……………………………………………. Street and No……………………………………… “What’s the $3
            for?” I ask. “Can’t you read? The $2 is to pay for the samples and instruction and the $1 as
        a security for our material. I don’t know who you are and if I gave you the thread I might
        never see you again.” “I don’t need instruction. I can make the stitch and I don’t want to
        put any such amount in samples. If you can’t trust me with a spool of thread and a pattern
        will you sell me the material?” “That’s not the way we do business. If you want to work for
            us you will have to comply with the contract. You pay $3; that entitles you to a sample mat
            which we teach you how to make. After you have <num type="wage" value="15.00">$15</num> made worth of work we refund the $1.”
        “What about the other $2?” “It goes to us for instruction and samples.” “Will I have to make
        the samples?” “Yes.” Then there are thirteen in the <orgName type="exposedCompany">Western Lace Manufacturing
            company</orgName>'s dozen?” “If you can to put it that way, yes. But you get one of each
        set.” “But I don’t want any. I have a supply. Tell me how much will you sell me a thirteenth
        of a dozen of this set for?” “The price is on the tag.” “Ah. I see 15 cents: and you pay 60
        cents a dozen for making them, a profit of $1.20. The best thing I’ve struck yet. And stock
        for sale?” The scowl becomes threatening, but I venture to ask how much thread it takes to
        mat for a closer calculation of the profits. No answer is deigned. “If I give you $3 you
        will give me work?” “Yes,” in a sullen tone. “How much?” “All you can do,” brightening up a
        little. “How do I know you will give me back $1 after I’ve earned $15?” I ask. “I don’t know
        anything about you. I never heard of your firm before and there is no name on this paper.”
        “I guess your motives are bad. You don’t want work.” “What guarantee have you to offer of
        honesty or respectability?” With glaring eyes, distended nostrils, and face crimson with
        rage he threw down a pile of 2-cent blank books in front of me. “There’s our customers:
        every state in the union is represented; go to them if you want references. Here are more
        too.” slamming down a sheet of paper with names and <placeName>Chicago</placeName> addresses of about forty women.
        ‘I see you have a minimum local trade. Chicago women don’t seem overzealous about the
        crocheting business.” Then I asked him where he got a market for the goods and the name of
        some business man to whom I could go for reference. “Now I am not going to do any more
        talking with you about this business.” “Why?? Is it a secret organization, a sort of
        Maso<unclear/>” “No. It isn’t secret or Ma<unclear/> either, but I don’t believe you’re all
        right and I won’t answer any more questions until I know who you are and what you want.”
        Poor <persName>Mr. Ford</persName> was so furious by this time that I thanked him for his
        attention and bade him good afternoon. At the foot of the stairs I waited to tie my veil on
        and see how <persName>Martha</persName> fared, but at the expiration of thirty minutes she

            <orgName type="exposedCompany">Rosenthal &amp; Co.’s and Rosenberg Bros</orgName>. I applied for work and was
        told to report in the morning to sew on <ref type="factoryItem">cloaks</ref>. The manager in
            <orgName type="exposedCompany">Stein’s</orgName>, on <desc type="location">Market street</desc>, wanted bands and
        offered to engage me at once. I was most impudently catechized some seven inquires requiring
        as many false statements. What was my name, place of residence, last position, amount of
        wages received, state of my health, nativity, married or single—to which I
            answered “neither.” Here was a dilemma. “Oh, yes, widow?” and
            an inordinate ha! ha!
        Yes.
        “Grass widow, eh?” with a sneer.
        How much do you pay for <ref type="factoryItem">cloaks</ref>, I asked, tired of the ordeal
        “<num type="wage" value=".50">Fifty cents</num>, each.” It was enough and I left the creature still anxious to solve the widow question. By the time I reached <orgName type="exposedCompany">Ludden’s</orgName>, <desc type="location">122 Market
            street</desc>, I was in a reckless frame of mind. “Is there any
        work for a good sewer?” I asked the girl in the office. “Yes, plenty.
            <persName>John</persName> give her some pants.” <persName>John</persName> had eyes the
        color of calico and a complexion like an immature tomato. He led the way to the <ref type="factoryItem">cottonades</ref>,
        which were cut, trimmed, and tied up in bundles of a dozen garments each. “Here’s a sample,”
        holding up a pair of <ref type="factoryItem">overalls of brown cottonade</ref>. “The work is cut out, but you will have to do everything yourself. I want you to make the fly extra strong and press the buttons. <desc type="wageDesc">We
        pay <num type="wage" value=".75">75 cents</num> a dozen</desc> and you find your own thread.” “<num type="wage" value=".75">Seventy-five cents</num> for a dozen of these
        <ref type="factoryItem">pants</ref> and find my own thread?” “Yes. <desc type="wageDesc">Or I’ll pay you <num type="wage" value=".80">80 cents</num> a dozen and give you linen thread if you sew the buttons on fast</desc>.” “No. I guess I won’t take the pants. What other work
        have you?” “Here are <ref type="factoryItem">cheviot shirts</ref> if you’d rather. Gusset the tail here and the sleeves,
        stay the bosom and arm-holes, and make the collar and wrist-bands extra strong. <desc type="wageDesc">These pay <num type="wage" value=".75">75
        cents</num> a dozen.</desc>” He offered to give me three on trial. <desc type="wageDesc">The thread would cost 5 cents,
        car-fare 10 cents, and I should have <num type="wage" value=".03">3 cents</num> after the job.</desc> <persName>John</persName> said:
        “That’s so, but I can’t help it. If the work is satisfactory you can have a six-dozen lot.”
         It was very good of <persName>John</persName> to sympathise with me, but I thanked him and
        said I would look a little further. THE NEVER-RIP JERSEY.
        A Hard Day’s Work for <num type="wage" value=".41">41 Cents</num>—Less Fortunate Workers Who Earned Only <num type="wage" value=".11">11 Cents</num>—A
            Sick Girl’s Sad Story—<desc type="workingClass">The Hopeless Miss Who Longed to Be Married</desc>. At the
                <orgName type="exposedCompany">Never-Rip Jersey Company</orgName> I was told to
        apply at the factory <desc type="location">133 West Washington street</desc>. “Work is given out at
        7:30 a. m.,” the clerk informed me, “and if you have any snap about you you can make a good
        living. By the way of getting the required snap I went home, ate my dinner, and was in bed
        at 8 o’ clock. <desc type="workingClass">The next morning I resumed the rags of poverty and at 7 o’clock made my debut
        as the factory hand.</desc> <desc type="workDesc">I was one of 120 women, ranging in age from 15 to
            60</desc>. The factory where the <ref type="factoryItem">never-rip jerseys</ref> are made is
        at the <desc type="location">corner of Washington and Union streets</desc>, with the elevator
        entrance in the rear and workroom in the fifth story. The girls began to arrive at 7
        o’clock, and at every trip of the elevator some twenty or more were carried up-stairs. I
        took a chair in one of the machine rows, and for an hour did nothing but watch the
        preparations for work in that human hive. The room was
        50x138, with an open unfinished roof and brick walls calcimined. Light was admitted from
        rear and side windows. <desc type="workDesc">The pressmen had their boards and furnaces at the south end of the
        room, where all the work was pressed prior to being boxed and ticketed for the trade. At the
        extreme opposite end was the cutting-room, fenced in from the rest, and between the two were
        the worktables, where the hundred odd girls stitched and finished the <ref type="factoryItem">jerseys</ref>.</desc>
        Along the brick walls were nails, irregularly driven, on which the girls hung their hats and
        wraps, dresses and collars. Nearly every one took off her dress and waisit, turned it inside
        out, put it on a nail and put on a calico of old stuff shop suit. A few took off their
        corsets and nearly all the machine hands changed their shoes before work. On the stroke of
        7:30 a bell rang, the power was turned on the machines began to buzz like little saw-mills
        and the day’s work had commenced. Heads of brown, black, yellow, and gray bent so near the
        flying shuttles that every minute I experted the bangs and fluffy crimps would get caught in
        the machinery.  The faces were sad and so very, very pales that I
                shall never look at a <ref type="factoryItem">jersey</ref> again without seeing
                them.
        <desc type="workDesc">The average age may have been 23, but not less.</desc>
        There were girls of 17 and 18 and some world-weary women past 50 all
            working for little more than enough to keep body and soul together.
        The work circulated in baskets—long chip hampers with stout-handles—that held a dozen, with
        room for five times that quantity. <desc type="workDesc">A great deal of time was lost by the
            workers in getting the contents of the basket examined, checked off on the ticket and
            the ticket stamped.</desc>
        <desc type="workingClass">If it had been the last change for life I don’t believe the girls would have worked
            any harder for salvation. Scarcely a head was raised from machine or lap.</desc>
        Shoulders were bent down, chests hollowed in, and
                faces drooped so low that I could not begin to make a study of the “windows of the
                souls” before me. At 8:40 the proprietor of the
        chair I was in asked me to vacate, and I walked down through the narrow aisles of
            <ref type="occupation">sewing-women</ref> to the “forelady” and asked for work.
        She asked me if I wanted to take a machine, but I expressed a preference for finishing. I
        was given a numbers, a basket with five <ref type="factoryItem">jerseys</ref> to finish, and a chair beside a
        girl named <persName>Hannah</persName>, who, being engaged by the way was told to “show me.”
            <persName>Hannah</persName> had blonde hair and talked with the brogue. <desc type="workDesc">She gave me a
        needle as long as my engagement finger, and the most meager instruction compatible with
        obedience. Fortunately I had my thimble and crossing my knees I threaded the
           gimlet-like needle with silk and I proceeded to
            hook-and-eye a <ref type="factoryItem">jersey</ref>.</desc> Remembering the treachery of
        my shop clothes I ever wore filled the two hooks and eyes with sewing and after testing them
        proceeded to face the collar. <desc type="workingClass">I told <persName>Hannah</persName> about my misery, but she
            wisely said it was no fault of hers and went on with a <desc type="wageDesc"><num type="wage" value="3.00">$3</num>-a-dozen lot she had been doing two
        days and a half</desc>.</desc> Thinking it would be a good way to get acquainted with my neighbors I asked
        several for a fine needle and at last exchanged the crow-bar <persName>Hannah</persName> had
        given me for a line cambric article. It worked better and at the end of two
        hours I had bound the arm-holes,
           faced the collar,
            tacked the front facing and the bustle
        piece, and put two patts of hooks and eyes in a black <ref type="factoryItem">jersey</ref>. The
            dye was not fast, neither was the wool, for my throat, ears,
            and nostrils were tufted with black lint. I was African from the nails to the wrists. The
        front facings had to be trimmed off. I had no scissors. <persName>Hannah</persName> was
        dangerous with her, and <desc type="wageDesc">I lost about 15 cents worth of time borrowing the weapons.</desc>
               At noon I had finished four <ref type="factoryItem">jerseys</ref> and was
                so sore about the neck and back that I could scarcely rise from the
                chair. I began to scent hot tea, and looking about saw
        a big girl called <persName>Emma</persName> brewing three pots of <placeName>Japan</placeName> over one of the
        press furnaces. She had her front hair in curl papers and was whistling “In The Sweet Bye
        and Bye.” About thirty girls went to her, each with her own cup, for a supply of tea. I
        remarked to one passing my chair that her tea looked awfully nice and asked where she got
        it. “From <persName>Em</persName>. She makes it and we each pay 2 cents a week.” On the
        stroke of 12 the machine stopped and 120 tired women stopped too, for thirty minutes’ rest
        and the food that could hardly be called refreshing. In the main it consisted of brown bread
        and butter. In some parcels there was cold meat and cake: others had pie; a few a bottle or
        canteen of milk, cold tea or coffee, but I did not see a particle of fruit. <desc type="workingClass">One little girl
        who had been stretching <ref type="factoryItem">jerseys</ref> at <num type="wage" value=".02">2 cents</num> each made a lunch on three graham
        crackers and a piece of custard pie, which she ate reading a paper-covered book. I counted
        thirty-seven girls with a lunch of dry bread, fifteen with sandwiches, and ten who ate cold
        pancakes. Twenty-three girls were without any luncheon whatever.</desc> During the intermission the
        elevator stopped running and no one left the building but myself. Less than ten minutes was
        spent over the wretched mea. At one side of the west wall, separated by a
            ten-foot pine partition, was the toilet-room containing an iron zinc with one faucet of
            running water.
        Here the girls crowded like so many cattle, each with her
        bit of soap and grimy cotton towel, to wash. Dress waists were loosened and necks, faces,
        arms, and hands lathered with soap and rinsed, as the change permitted. There were three
        closets, unflushed, untidy, and unwholesome. Set up against the wall in this enclosure, with
        the faucet run through the partition, was a barrel of ice water inscribed in big letters:
          “Two cents will be collected every Saturday for ice
          water.” Besides this luxury every hand pays 12 cents a week for the
        use of the machine. At 1 o’clock I finished my basket, which I dragged to
            <persName>Tom</persName>, the book-keeper, who took my name and credited me with five
        garments. <desc type="wageDesc">No price had been put on the <ref type="factoryItem">jerseys</ref>, as they were sampled goods, but
        the forelady thought they would go at <num type="wage" value=".60">60 cents</num> a dozen, which meant <num type="wage" value=".25">25 cents</num> to my credit.</desc> I
        didn’t get any more work till 2 o’clock because <desc type="middleClass">the forelady was in the
        toilet-room having her bangs done up in paper. She was a pretty woman, by the way, with a
        good face and a shock of beautiful auburn hair. She had been in her position for six years
        and was drawing a salary of <num type="wage" value="35.00">$35</num> a week. The girls had a good word for her generally, but she
        struck me as being a woman without heart.</desc> At her appearance I was given a basketful of
            <ref type="factoryItem">jerseys</ref> to finish button-holes. I
            worked like a Trojan for an hour, at the end of which I won the heart
        of a little girl who sat at the end of my table facing the wall. She had been sitting still
        so long that I called out and asked if she were ill. “No. I haven’t any work.”
                    Tired almost to exhaustion and as
                    hot as a newly-built mustard plaster I was only too glad of a chance to transfer
                    my interests, but she declined.
        It was too hot to work; she was going away soon, she said, and didn’t care to do any more.
        “When did I begin? Today. I worked in a <ref type="industry">box-factory</ref>, but it was so dull I could only earn <num type="wage" value=".16">16
        cents</num> a day. <desc type="livingConditions">My mother wants me to pay her $2.50 a week board, but how could I with <num type="wage" value=".96">96
            cents</num>.</desc> This is no better. I came at 8 this morning and I have only made <num type="wage" value=".11">11 cents</num>. I am 21.
        <desc type="workingClass">Beaus? Yes, some. I have on steady fellow, but I don’t know if he will marry me. I hope he
        will.</desc> She told me he earned <desc type="wageDesc"><num type="wage" value="75.00">75$</num> a month as a telegraph operator on the board of trade</desc>; that
        he was “steady as a steeple, and the only fellow she ever loved.” I told her how to go about
        catching the prosperous telegrapher and rehashed a recipe given me by no less a personage
        than <persName>Mrs. John M. Sherwood</persName>, which I had never tried. She was going to a
        picnic at <placeName>Garfield park</placeName> at 6 o’clock and brought over a 25-cent
        chocolate cake to show me. Then she loaned me her scissors, told me good-by, and went home
        to dress for the fete. <desc type="workingClass">Nothing of any importance occurred till someone passed the news that
        a girl was asleep in the closet. Half a dozen left their machines to look at her,
            <persName>Hannah</persName>, my mentor, among them. “Oh, you just ought to see her, fast
        asleep, with her mouth wide open.” It was more than I could stand.</desc> I threw my
            button-holes into the basket and went to the toiletroom.
            <desc type="workingClass"> Sure enough, there was the poor girl sitting in the dirty place, her
            head resting against a folded apron, breathing in the foul air that reeked with filth
            and disease. The walls of the closet were black with pencil marks,
        the floor was strewn with lint and threads, and the pale face of the sleeper looked ghastly
        in the darkness. She had tied one end of a string to the latch and the other to the drop
        chain.</desc> “My dear child, musnt’t sleep here. Are you sick?” “Oh, I am so sick.”
            Instantly there were a dozen willing hands to help her out to a window
            where a chair was placed for her. We rubbed her temples, chafed her hands, bathed her
            head, and got her some lemons. After making her toilet she came over to my
        table as I sewed away at my button-holes she told me her story.
            “<persName>Rose</persName> and I are only six months in this country. We came from
            <placeName>England</placeName> with our brother and live on <desc type="location">Carpenter
            street</desc>. The climate doesn’t agree with me and I am sick all the time. At
        first we worked in <orgName type="exposedCompany">Marshall Field’s</orgName> and <persName>Rose</persName> and I
        made fringe. <desc type="wageDesc">We got <num type="wage" value="7.00">$7</num> a week and were so happy.</desc> It was awful nice there. We didn’t have to
        pay for drinking water or anything; there were lots of towels, whole cakes of soap, and oh,
        it was so clean. We had a foreman over us and he was as good as a brother to us. Sometimes
        we let our money lay and drew it in a pile; oh, such a lot as it was! We put away very much
        of it. But I got sick and all we ‘ad saved went for doctor and medicine. Then the work
        stopped. They took our names though and promised to send for us in the fall. For a while we
        worked in the box factory, but liked to starve. Then we went to
            <orgName type="exposedCompany">Ellinger’s</orgName> and made <ref type="factoryItem">cloaks</ref> at <num type="wage" value=".30">30 cents</num> each, but it was
        so hard, and we couldn’t please them no matter how we tried. We came here today, but it’s
        only a fit place to starve in. All the work they gave me was a dozen <ref type="factoryItem">jerseys</ref> to
        button; that’s <num type="wage" value=".11">11 cents</num> a row; had two dozen holes to finish at <num type="wage" value=".16">16 cents</num>. <num type="wage" value=".27">Twenty-seven cents</num>
        for the two of us! How can we live on it?” and the child began to cry again. By way of
        comforting her I took her name, promised to help her, and gave her my check for <num type="wage" value=".41">41 cents</num>.
        She didn’t think it would be honored so I took it to the cashier myself and demanded pay as
        I was not coming back in the morning. “No, ma’am,” said <persName>Tom</persName>, “you don’t
            get it. Come round on the <date when="---20">20th</date> and I hunt you up.” At 5:30 work ceased. <desc type="workDesc">Each girl had to
        sweep out her place, clean and oil the machine, and return her basket and check.</desc> I paid a
        nickel to have my corner swept, and finding it impossible to wash up sans towel and soap I
        got under my veil and rang the elevator. The pressers laughed and told me to try the
        stairs—five flights. Down I went. At the second I went into the salesroom to buy a
            <ref type="factoryItem">jersey</ref>. One of the firm waited on me; his magnanimity was sublime. The
        identical black <ref type="factoryItem">jersey</ref> that I had received <num type="wage" value=".05">5 cents</num>for finishing was offered to
        me at $2. I declined. By way of interest, one hundred dozen garments are turned out of the
        factory every day in the year. As near as I could learn the salaries average $4 a week, but
        plenty of grown women are not allowed to earn over 28 cents a day. Work begins at 7:30 a. m.
        and 12:30 p. m. Anyone five minutes late working on time is fined an hour’s pay, and for the
        loss of an hour the pay of half a day is knocked off. Piece-workers who are late are kept
        idle form one to three hours. A girl who loses her ticket forfeits pay for the entire work,
        not withstanding the entry is on the books of the firm.
