        <h3>A Preface by Nell Nelson: Chicago, Sept. 30, 1888.</h3>
        <p>The labor of learning something, and of making that acquired knowledge public, concerning
            the real life led by the working girls of a great city, was accomplished in the regular
            routine of newspaper duty, and at the request of the editor of the Chicago Times. The
            duty was performed, however, with a feeling of interest and a sense of responsibility
            greater than ordinarily follows obedience to a newspaper assignment. There was an
            earnest endeavor, excited by a day’s experience and subsequently increased to give all
            absolute facts with all their bearings and to portray with exceptional fidelity and
            guardedness the state of things as existing. It is possible that in the wording of some
            sentence, in the turning of some phrase, injustice has been done to some employers --
            though through no misstatement of facts. If so, it has been impulsive and unintentional
            and must be so accepted and understood. I tried simply to tell of what I saw. The
            appearance of these articles in book form was neither my idea nor within my design when
            writing them. With the request to write this brief introduction comes my first knowledge
            of the undertaking.<br/></p><p id="signature">- Nell Nelson.</p>
