        <h2>Analyzing Adjectives</h2>
        <div id="vocab">
            <div id="vocabListText">
                <p>The following list is a visualization of adjectives that appear three or more times, in the entire collection of articles, and the count of times they appear. The <a href="https://github.com/RJP43/CitySlaveGirls-ChicagoDailyTimes1888/blob/master/Website2015/webDevelopment/vocabulary.xsl">XSLT</a> to create this list runs over our currently transcribed 1888 articles from the <i>Chicago Times</i>: 7/30, 8/2, 8/4, and 8/9. Our purpose behind this list was to exemplify Nell Nelson's distinct vocabulary. We asked, when exposing the plight of the working girl, what language do both Nelson and the people she interviewed use? For this list, we chose to represent the adjectives in particular because of Nelson's unique way of describing the companies, people, and environment she encountered during her expose. We also chose to represent the adjectives because the series was published with the intention to expose the details of industrialized Chicago and seeing the adjectives that appear most, in the whole series, shed light on the repetitive qualities of those details.</p>
                <p>We tagged all nouns, possesive pronouns, and adjectives with the element 'w', with @type specifying if the word was being used as a noun or adjective. For nouns, @ana was used if the word was directly linked to one of our character archetypes (Nell Nelson, working girl, foreperson, employer, employee, benefactor, messenger, or unidentified). For adjectives, @ana was used to label the 'stem' of the word (example: lazy, lazier, and laziest all have the same @ana='lazy'). For possessive pronouns, @subtype='poss' was added. In this case, @ana represents the character archetype taking posession. The nouns, adjectives, and possessive pronouns were linked with the element 'seg'. Disclaimer: the extensive markup required for this system of tagging is extremely time consuming. A significant amount of the article's text gets tagged; therefore, not all of the articles have this markup (as of December 2015) and the articles that do may not have all of the intended word types (nouns, adjectives, possesive pronouns) tagged correctly.</p>
