            <div id="content_text"> This website is designed with the intention to restore Nell
                Nelson’s instrumental work in exposing the cruel and unsanitary working conditions
                of Chicago’s manufacturing industry during the late nineteenth century. Nelson’s
                series, "City Slave Girls," was published in <i>The Chicago Times</i> in late-July,
                1888. Nelson was a pioneer of investigative reporting and provided ground-breaking
                exposure of the ill-effects of industrialization. The series completely exposed the
                mistreatment of the women, children, and the impoverished that worked in Chicago's
                manufacturing industries.</div>
