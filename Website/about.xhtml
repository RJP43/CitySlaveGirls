                    <b>Research Question ---</b> In 1888, the <i>Chicago Daily Times</i> published Nell Nelson's "City Slave Girls" Series with the intention to expose the corruption and inhumane conditions of Chicago Industrialization. In the same year, two books were written incorporating almost entire articles of the series; however, both of the book versions exclude important aspects used in the newspaper series to reveal the horrid truths behind Chicago's corrupt industries. The data collection used on this webpage should illustrate what kind of information was altered and excluded. Therefore, we question: 1. What was left out and/or changed? 2.How did the book publications change the clearly, disgusted image portrayed in the orignial <i>Chicago Daily Times</i> publication?
                </p> 
<b>Project Goals/Timeline ---</b> 
                <ul>
                    <li>Determine important tags that will define the changes and deletions between versions.</li>
                    <li>Code the Articles from the original publication of the series.</li>
                    <li>Code the Book Chapters of the McEnnis Text and take note of the changes between the original articles and where the articles are referenced in the chapters.</li>
                    <li>Use XSLT to display text-only on website (including drawing tables thatexpand on the ones that are in the original text of chapter 1).</li>
                    <li>After noticing the interesting connotations of femVoice, mascVoice, and nellVoice decided to use XQuery to determine the number of times each connotation is used by each voice and the differences between each voice's representation of said connotations in the McEnnis text versus the original publication (document in table format).</li>
                    <li>Use SVG in XQuery to graph the various voices and various connotation occurances in both the book and articles -- graph displays how certain connotations are taken out in the book that are very present in the original articles.</li>
                    <li>To further support the censorship of the book article-references use image-mapping to tag all the location addresses named in the articles that are all left out in the book text (have XQuery table of name "identified" vs name="unidentified" showing the general names used in the books for locations and companies versus the specific names and locations used in the original articles.</li>
                 <li> Use javascript to toggle the type of workingConditions focused on in the McEnnis Text (in the the preface of the McEnnis text it is emphasized that the purpose of revealing these truths were to agitate for change. This will be used in later project development to compare to the newspaper's headlines in another comparison of what is different between the two.</li>     
             </ul>
             <p>
                 <b>Future Project Development ---</b> This is an on-going project. First all of the original articles need to be finished with XML coding. Then all of the book chapters from both books need to be coded. Once everything is coded, continued comparisons need to be made between the books versus the newspaper publication. In the end, this webpage will hopefully illustrate the importance of Nell Nelson and the "City Slave Girls" Series in American History.

            <h2>Background Information</h2>
            <p><b>Nell Nelson:</b> Helen Cusack-Carvalho used the pseudonym Nell Nelson when she wrote the "City Slave Girls" series in 1888. She was employed by the <i>Chicago Daily Times</i> and then later, following the success of her series in Chicago, hired by New York's <i>The World</i>. The biographical information on Helen Cusack-Carvalho is considerably illusive and currently anything remotely to a complete biography of her is nonexistent. The primary source of information regarding her biography comes from a <a href="http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/17511341211188655">journal article by Eric W. Liguori in 2012</a>. In this article, Liguori alludes that Helen was born into the middle-class and that her career as a journalist allowed for her to maintain this status. Liguori reports that Helen married above her social class to a man named Solomon Solis Carvalho in 1895. After marriage, Helen's journalism career ceased to exist and she lived the remainder of her life raising their two daughters. . According to an obituary found in a 1945 <i>New York Times</i>' publication Helen died in New Jersey. The obituary lacks any special recognition of her investigative series despite the popularity and influential effects it had on the labor reforms of the late nineteenth century.</p>
            <p><b>“City Slave Girls” Exposé:</b> The "City Slave Girls" series ran daily on the front-page of <i>The Chicago Daily Times</i>. The first article was published on July 30th, 1888 and the concluding article was published on September 3rd, 1888.  Helen Cusack-Carvalho posed as Nell Nelson, a poor female working girl, and reported in-depth on the living conditions, wages, and work environment of nineteenth century industialization. The early publication of the series places 'Nelson' as a pioneer of investigative reporting. 'Nelson' provided ground-breaking work in exposing the mistreatment of the women and children that worked in Chicago’s manufacturing industries. The success of her series is a bewilderment considering the extensive inversion of social norms represented in the writing of her exposé. The “City Slave Girls” series put into question the practices of the most prestigious men of Chicago; yet, 'Nell Nelson' was a woman unable to even vote due to the gender restraints of her time. Through her satirical and witty writing, 'Nelson' beat the adversity of being a woman in the nineteenth century and the publication of the series gained attention from Chicago’s political representatives along with the owners of the very industries she scrutinized.  After the intial publication of the series, two books were printed within the same year recognizing 'Nelson' and her investigative  work. In addition to the two books, Nelson was hired by <i>The World</i> to reproduce a similar series in New York. Although the significance of the series was recognized at the time of publication and for some time after, Nelson’s role in exposing the hardships of the “City Slave Girls” lacks any proper representation in history as of today. The “City Slave Girl” series should be a monumental resource of information for women’s history, labor history, and the history of undercover journalism.</p>
