            <p>One of the chance acquaintances I made at the jersey factory worked three
               days for J--- S---- &amp; C, Market street, receiving 65 cents for her
               labors about ten days after leaving. One-third of 65 cents is 21 2/3
               cents.
            </p>
            
            <p>That is the way S---- &amp; Co. solve the problem; but the question is one
               that capital, Christianity, and civilization are invited to analyze.
            </p>
            
            <p>"Don't never go to S----'s," the little girl said, "it's an awful place."</p>
            
            <p>On Saturday I tumbled out of bed at 6 A.M. and donned my factory clothes. On
               the way down-town the street-car met with an eight-minute obstruction in the
               shape of a load of bricks, and when I reached the manufacturing
               establishment of J--- S---- &amp; C it was 8:32 o'clock. The elevator took
               me up one story and I was told to "get out." I told the boy at the rope that
               I wished to go up to the work room.
            </p>
            
            <p>"You're too late," he said. "Have to take the freight ele- vator down at the
               back of the store."
            </p>
            
            <p>Down I walked as directed past long tables, that towered with long cloaks,
               dolmans, ulsters, jackets, and short wraps; past two or three busy
               unobserving clerks, past a pair of forbidding-gooking men who glared at me
               from under their black hats and blacker brows; past an earthen-gray-stringy
               crash towel that waved at half-mast over a dirty wash-basin, past a tier of
               closets that emitted a stifling odor, and on down to the packing-room. I
               waited for a big lusty packer to finish pummelling the mischievous little
               Swede who ran the elevator and  was carried up to the top floor
               with a box of cloth. When the car landed I found myself at the extreme end
               of a room 50x80 feet, in an enclosure of wire-fence, packing-boxes, and
               cutting- boards - beyond and between which I could see perhaps two hundred
               persons, mostly women, bent over machines, and working as only slaves ever
               work. The thundering noise made by the machinery deadened every other sound,
               even that made by the cutters as they ran their heavy shears through the
               satin and muslin trimmings. Sixteen persons passed me - men in undershirts,
               trousers and slippers, with work in their hands; men in business suits with
               work in their brains; girls of 13 in rags and death-like pallor, with work
               in their arms; older and paler girls and still older and paler women, some
               with white hair and spectacles, carrying work to be pressed, examined,
               altered or checked. Nobody noticing me, I asked a pretty little girl who was
               cutting a bolt of satin into cuff-lining to direct me to the forewoman and
               was told to go and sit down till she came. I had hardly arranged myself on
               an empty box when a playful young man capsized my throne and spilled me in a
               heap of unmade cloaks. My first impulse was for revenge, but remembering
               that I was a poor girl looking for work I contented myself by petting my
               damaged left knee and right elbow. While mentally photographing the
               miserable, little, bullet-headed sapling who caused my trouble, a young
               woman brought me a chair and placed it in a corner, which convenient spot
               happened to be off a narrow passage leading to the work- room proper. My
               nose was not long in seeing a row of closets that walled the south side of
               the passageway. Overhead was a pasteboard sign with "No admission to the
               work-room" printed in large, black letters. There was no place beyond where
               I could sit or stand without being in the way unless I went back into the
               freight elevator, so I resolved to stick it out.
            </p>
            
            <p>For almost two hours I sat in the dark, filthly place with a 
               handkerchief over my mouth and nose waiting for the fore- woman to come and
               admit me to the shop. I watched the poor girls pass and repass, their broken
               shoes slipping up and down with every step, and their ragged skirts often
               catching new gaps from the nails of the packing boxes. Just as I was
               beginning to get myself in a state of passivity, as prescribed by Mrs. Eddy,
               and was combatting the foul smell of the closets with the wholesome healthy
               atmosphere of South Park, something in my head seemed to give way, and the
               whole factory turned into a colossal whirligig. The big goose of the presser
               and the little irons of the press girls began to play tag, and machines,
               operators, finishers, wire-forms, cutters, examiners, messengers, models,
               forewomen, teachers and firm, all joined in the merry go round. To escape
               being knocked in the head by a two-story press-board I clutched a little
               stitcher who said:
            </p>
            
            <p>"You an't sick, is you?"</p>
            
            <p>I guessed I was. Bringing me a tin cup full of water, she departed saying:
               "She'd be docked if she didn't go."
            </p>
            
            <p>An old man with grey hair and glasses showed me to the freight elevator and I
               was let down to the second story. When I reached the staircase I sat down on
               the top step to recover. A portly man with a straw hat, full beard, broad
               shoulders, and a suit of mixed goods, mistaking me for a tramp, came out
               from the stock and informed me that "no peddlers are allowed on the
               premises. Move off."
            </p>
            
            <p>I moved off determined to return another day. </p>
