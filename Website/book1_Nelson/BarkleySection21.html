            <p>On the southwest corner of Washington boulevard and Union street, towers a
               spacious brick building, on the third floor of which H. W. K. &amp; Co.
               manufacture much of the clothing that supplies the country trade. The place
               is far from uninviting. Clean halls and well-kept stairs proclaim the
               faithful service of a janitor, and the girl who has worked in 
               "other shops" blesses the man at the rope every time she rides in the neat
               mirror-lined elevator.
            </p>
            
            <p>"H. W. K.," calls out the pilot. "First door to your right. Open and ring."
               Entering I found myself in an iron cage looking through the grating into the
               shop. I felt like a felon waiting to be sentenced, but when I found the bell
               I gave it three vigorous pulls and peered in at the workers. It was the same
               show of bondwomen, with round shoulders, bowed heads, red, brown, black,
               gold, and yellow hair, actually brushing the machine arms, faces of that
               ghastly pallor peculiar to down-trodden youth. Nearly all were clad and shod
               in the rags of poverty. The machines were run by steam and the rumble
               overhead and the whizz along the floor deadened all other vibration. I
               counted eighty girls who bent over their machines, working with an industry
               that was simply fierce. Did you ever price a pair of overalls?
            </p>
            
            <p>Well, they can't be bought in this town for less than 75 cents, the very
               price that H. W. K. &amp; Co. pay an experienced operator for making a dozen
               pairs. The operator must be experienced, for the firm don't want learners;
               they won't be bothered with them. They have no time to teach. Anybody who
               comes to their store is expected to buy, and anyone who comes to their shop
               is expected to work and work well. It is not that it takes time to teach a
               new girl how to press her knee against the power wheel, how to hold the
               goods, and how to thread the wind-running machine, but there is the wasted
               cotton, the unnecessary handling of the jeans and cottonade that takes the
               dressing off, and the skilled labor that would be sure to come by and ask
               for the chair if the learner, the wretched beginner, ambitious for more
               bread, was not in the chair. This skilled labor can be relied upon for that
               excellence of work and attention to detail that characterize custom work.
               Your fashionable tailors may pay $3 for having a pair of 
               trousers made, but the stitching is not a whit better than Mr. K. gets on
               cloth pants for $1.25 a dozen. The difference is in the fabric, in the
               sewing silk, and the trimmings, but slip- shod work is not accepted from the
               "sweaters." Let one of them run crooked leg seam and the forewoman will
               fling the garment back, command correction, promise dismissal if the
               negligence is repeated, and you can depend upon her for keeping her
               word.
            </p>
            
            <p>I tell you, swell dressmakers and private family seamstresses who get $3 a
               day and your dinner and supper, these young girls who are slowly grinding
               out their lives for the wholesale shops, the middle shop, and the slop-shop,
               would put you to shame could the quality and quantity of their work and your
               work be compared. Placed in one of these factories with a machine in front
               of you and a dozen overalls at your feet at 75 cents a dozen, it would be
               more than four weeks before you could earn that amount each day.
            </p>
            
            <p>It is not enough to see that these girls can finish six, ten, twelve,
               eighteen, or twenty-four of these pants in ten hours, but to appreciate the
               work and calculate rightly the terrible exhaustion, one must take the
               machine, take the garments and take the experience for one's self.
            </p>
            
            <p>While I waited in the little, wire-fenced vestibule for some one to answer my
               ring I saw a girl of fifteen years or so faint at her work and drop over on
               the machine table. Although her comrades were on both sides no one looked to
               her condition till their seams were finished. The girl on the left brushed
               the matted hair up from the pale forehead, rubbed her white face with her
               stained hand and advised her to go home.
            </p>
            
            <p>Did she? No. She lay on her arms with her eyes closed and the cool air from
               the open window fanning her face. Across the way a building was being
               erected and fragments of the material came in with the breeze, but her
               sensibilities were  not offended, and she slept at her silent
               shuttle and smiled as she slept, as if in defiance of the dust and lime and
               thundering noises of the mighty machinery of power and wealth.
            </p>
            
            <p>The gate was opened by a man who referred me to the fore- woman at the rear
               end of the shop. I walked back through a perfect avenue of material. Fabrics
               on the left towered far above the heads of the girls, bolts of uncut cloth,
               boxes of trimming, and bundles of cut goods composing the wall. On the right
               stretched work tables with newly-made flannel shirts, laborers' overalls and
               shirts and woolen pants, rising tier upon tier waiting to be ticketed and
               boxed and shipped north, west, and south as far as the trade stretches. The
               forewoman was not unpleasant and by no means unkind. She did not need any
               help.
            </p>
            
            <p>"Then why don't you take your sign down? I asked.</p>
            
            <p>"Well, I'll tell you. I have all the girls I can possibly accommodate. All
               the machines are taken, but all may not suit. Some of the girls are not
               doing well, but I want to give them a few days more and if I see they can't
               do the work I'll discharge them. Then I'll give you a chance, or any one who
               calls."
            </p>
            
            <p>"But they are working. See how they work! It's inhuman to work women that
               way."
            </p>
            
            <p>"You think so? Well, we won't talk about that now. Yes, they are working, but
               they have to do a certain quantity of work to be satisfactory."
            </p>
            
            <p>"What do you call a certain quantity?"</p>
            
            <p>"Well, enough to justify us in having them about. The work is cut and has to
               be made to fill the orders of the house."
            </p>
            
            <p>"What do you pay a dozen?"</p>
            
            <p>"I pay seventy-five cents for some kind and eighty-five cents for better
               overalls; one dollar for others, and one dollar twenty- five for wools."
            </p>
            
            <p>"And the finishers?"</p>
            
            
            <p>"Twenty-five cents a dozen. That is, to turn up the bottoms. All the other
               work is done by machine. It's not hard work."
            </p>
            
            <p>A good deal harder than I should care to engage in for my daily bread.</p>
            
            <p>Here, as elsewhere, the weekly stipend varies from a fair competence to
               starvation wages. Plenty of hands earn three, four, four and a half and five
               dollars a week, and a minimum by slaivish industry and an experience beyond
               their years succeed in making seven, eight, nine, and ten dollars.
            </p>
            
            <p>The factory is well managed, and H. W. K. &amp; Co. will get full value of
               every penny paid the poor, pale, slight young women. Be it said to the
               credit of these manufacturers their factory is abundantly lighted and
               ventilated. The walls are finished, the calcimine is white and pleasing, and
               the floors are kept clean. There is a toilet-room near the center of the
               shopâ€”a big place, with three closets, a long sink, and not any too much
               light. The plumbing is perfect, and the girls revel in the luxury of three
               long towels a day. The towels, and closets, though, are few enough for the
               convenience of a hundred girls.
