            <p>I next made application for work at W's, on Wabash avenue, where hundreds of
               girls are employed on corsets, bustles, skirts, jerseys and cloaks. Boarding
               the freight elevator I was drawn up to the top floor, where a pretty little
               Jewess informed me that Mr. S. was engaged, but would see me in a little
               while. She showed me to a seat in the rear end of the store at the entrance
               to the shop-room, and for a single hour I listened to the drop, drop, drop
               of the heavy machinery and the snatches of song and merriment between the
               iron roar. Presently Mr. W. came and sat by me.
            </p>
            
            <p>"Did you want work?" he asked.</p>
            
            
            <p>"Very much.</p>
            
            <p>"What kind of work have you been doing?"</p>
            
            <p>I admitted I had never worked in a factory, but told him I could sew and was
               willing to do anything that would give me a living.
            </p>
            
            <p>"Well, you ought to have a chance - a good chance if you are willing to work
               - but it's dull just now and I don't see where we can put you. You say you
               can sew. Run the ma- chine too? Well, we start our skirt and cloak rooms in
               a couple of weeks, and then we can try you."
            </p>
            
            <p>"But I must have work," I persisted, "at once. Mr. W. sighed a little and
               left me to see a customer who had just then entered. While I was fixing up a
               romance in case any inquiry was made as to my age, name, residence and
               position in life, a sad-faced Irish mother came up the four stories with a
               sixteen-year-old daughter. They were as poorly dressed as myself, but
               considerably less happy. The mother's hands were hard, thin and work-worn,
               and her face seamed with care. She wore an old bonnet, a coarse black dress,
               poor shoes, an old shawl, and an expression of injury, despondency and
               severity. Annie was a well-developed girl, with a good, wholesome face, red
               cheeks, bright, fun-loving eyes, big hands and feet, a most ungainly manner,
               and a nice figure. She had been crying, for her lashes were wet, and she
               seemed expectant that a crisis of some sort was near at hand. I soon learned
               that the mother missed her calling when she adopted maternal duties. The
               family lived in the region of Blue Island avenue and consisted of the
               parents and growing children, two or three having married. Annie was the
               youngest and "had to do something for her grub, " as the mother said. For a
               long, time she worked in a box factory and made good wages, but the work was
               not steady, and last January she came to W.'s.
            </p>
            
            <p>And what do you think she did?</p>
            
            <p>She earned 80 cents a week cutting dress reeds from 7:30  o'clock
               in the morning until 5:30 in the evening. Annie will be 17 years old in
               September. Here is her account of the work:
            </p>
            
            <p>"Oh yes, I like it. They don't pay me much, but the fore- lady's good to me,
               and Mr. ---- is awful kind. The girls is nice, too. The only thing I don't
               like is that they're always cuttin' me down. I can't make hardly
               nothing."
            </p>
            
            <p>"Last week? Oh, last week I wasn't here. I staid home. It was so hot I didn't
               want to take the trouble to come down for 13 cents a day and walk and put up
               my lunch."
            </p>
            
            <p>Thinking the girl's calculations were amiss I turned to the mother, who
               confirmed the statement, adding: "It don't pay to feed that kid to work on
               the pay she's getting."
            </p>
            
            <p>"It's what all the girl's gets," added Annie, beginning to cry. I played
               mother for a little while, told her she was a good girl to help her parents
               and not to mind, for there was plenty of work, and if she comes to the Times
               I'll help her get it.
            </p>
            
            <p>After the Irish gray eyes had been dried with both corners of her little
               black shawl she gave me the prices at which she had been working. Here they
               are:
            </p>
            
            <p>One cent a gross for cutting steels in eleven, fifteen and eighteen inch
               length. The work is done by machine, the operator using one foot and both
               hands constantly.
            </p>
            
            <p>Four cents a gross for sewing buckles on bustles.</p>
            
            <p>Three cents a dozen for basting bustles.</p>
            
            <p>Four cents a dozen for springing bustles.</p>
            
            <p>Seventy cents a dozen for putting elastics on reeds and box- ing the
               same.
            </p>
            
            <p>Wages in this department vary from 60 cents to $3 a week, $1.50 being a very
               fair average, and this too, for girls of 19 years and less.
            </p>
            
            <p>When the manager had dismissed his guest he waited on  Annie's
               mother, who turned traitress, betraying her own child to the enemy in this
               style:
            </p>
            
            <p>"Can Annie come back, sir?" she asked.</p>
            
            <p>"Why, I guess so. What's been the matter?"</p>
            
            <p>Annie rolled her finger up in black fringe, hung her head, and allowed the
               tears to stream down her cheeks.
            </p>
            
            <p>"Oh she's so sassy," kindly volunteered the mother, "and she comes home to me
               with a batch of stories every night about your cuttin' down the prices. Sure
               I can't believe a word she says."
            </p>
            
            <p>"Well, you come in the morning, Annie, and I'll see what we can do for you."
               With this dismissal poor Annie followed her mother, who doubtless felt that
               she had done her duty by the child.
            </p>
            
            <p>I recited my piece to the low-voiced gentleman, who said there was plenty of
               work in the bustle department, but he guessed it wouldn't be pleasant for
               me, as the girls were only sixteen or so. I tried to assure him that I
               didn't care about the company, that I only wanted a chance to make a living
               for myself.
            </p>
            
            <p>"Well, I don't think you could earn enough to support yourself at machine
               work. Come in about Monday and I
               thin we can give you something at $3
               or so."
            </p>
            
            <p>"Three dollars a week?"</p>
            
            <p>"Yes."</p>
            
            <p>"God have mercy on the girls," I said reverently and departed.</p>
