            <p>I did not realize the ignominious position of respectable pov- erty till I
               went to E's cloak factory, where labor is bondage, the laboror a slave, and
               flesh and blood cheaper than needles and thread. Corporations are said to be
               without heart, but this concern is a commercial inquisition. It puts its
               help on the plane of slavery, and nothing but civil law prevents the use of
               the lash.
            </p>
            
            <p>The factory is on the third floor of the large brick building at the east end
               of Madison street bridge on the south side of the street.
            </p>
            
            <p>Elevator? Not much.</p>
            
            <p>An elevator is a luxury, and luxuries have no place at E's. You will be short
               of breath when you reach the top of the fourth flight, but in recovering you
               have time to take in the surroundings - a great barn of a place with a
               single charm of good light. There is plenty of vacant room, but the women
               are huddled together, elbows touching along the line of machines. Beneath
               the west windows flows the river; at the south end of the room, not ten feet
               from the crowded table, is a tier of closets, and on hot days the combined
               odor of the two is shocking. Nobody in his employ dare complain about
               smells, cold, heat, work, wages or rules. But whoever heard of martyrs
               complaining?
            </p>
            
            
            <p>My experience began at 7:50 A.M. and lasted just three hours. When I climbed
               the dusty stairs I took a ten-minute rest at the top. Everybody was at work
               but a hungry-looking man about 27 years old, with skin the color of a Russia
               turnip and thin, peaked features. He was dressed in a pair of heel- less
               slippers, a white shirt, and a pair of shop pants that a clothing store pays
               18 cents for making. Neither collar, vest, coat nor suspenders burdened his
               emaciated form. He moved among the workers with a cat-like tread, his
               shoulders drooping and his knees opening and shutting with a sort of
               accordion movement at every step. He passed me several times as I stood at
               the desk and eyed me so unpleasantly that I turned my back to him.
            </p>
            
            <p>After waiting at the desk for three-quarters of an hour, I asked the clerk, a
               sweet little girl of 16 years, with pretty red cheeks and dark eyelashes and
               hair, for work, and was told to wait till the-forelady came round. A dozen
               girls were waiting too, some with cloaks, others with check-books and
               tickets, and a few with hand-made fringe. The fringe-girl I spoke to. She
               told me she received 5 cents a yard for making an imitation of seal-ball
               fringe, such as winter cloaks are trimmed with. She had a piece three yards
               and a quarter long that had taken her all the previous day to make. Here was
               a child of 15 working nine and a half hours a day for a competence of 16 1/4
               cents. Will the Prairie avenue woman, who, at the suggestion of Mrs. Ormison
               Chant, is trying to find one hundred girls who are earning less than 28
               cents a day please enter "Maggie W--- on the list, and will the women of the
               P--- agency who want a new field of inquiry, call and see this slim,
               snake-gaited, jaundice-faced creature who has charge of this human mill.
            </p>
            
            <p>Maggie's fringe being measured and her book checked, she was given another
               box of material and went off to weave it into tassel-trimming. The girl who
               took her place would not be interviewed. She didn't know how much stitchers
               earned  and wouldn't tell how much a week she could make." She
               was, possibly, 25 years old, with a deathly pale face, and looked as if she
               hadn't eaten any breakfast. Her successor was less reticent. "I'm here since
               May, but I don't like it; the boss is a horrid thing. Him and the forelady
               watches us all the time, and they don't give us hardly any work. I can only
               make one cloak a day; some pays 30 cents, some 40 cents, and some 50.
               Yesterday I had only 60 cents coming to me for two days. Are you long here?
               Oh, you won't stay. They search your bag and your pocket when you go home
               nights to see if you have any thread or pieces about you."
            </p>
            
            <p>Before I had a chance to talk w'ith another unfortunate the little
               rosy-cheeked clerk told me "it's against the rules for new hands to stand
               here. You must go over by the stairs and wait till the forelady comes." I
               smiled at the pretty child and she rewarded me by bringing a chair to me a
               few minutes later. All means of
               cummunication being cut off I amused
               myself making sketches of the shirted, slippered, sleuth-like creature as he
               passed.
            </p>
            
            <p>This pastime was interrupted by the appearance of a fat woman. She had on a
               black sateen suit that fitted her puffy figure like the raiment of a well
               boiled suet pudding. She carried herself like a drum major on a dress parade
               and by way of ornaments wore a gold watch with a double coil of gold chain
               at her belt, gold earrings, a gold breast pin, gold cuff- buttons and two
               gold rings. Bigger than bust or bustle was the woman's head I discovered
               when I asked :
            </p>
            
            <p>"Are you the forewoman?"</p>
            
            <p>"Forelady, yes. What do you want?"</p>
            
            <p>"Work."</p>
            
            <p>"What can you do ?"</p>
            
            <p>"Sew."</p>
            
            <p>"Where have you been working?"</p>
            
            <p>"N. R. Co."</p>
            
            
            <p>"Want to stitch?"</p>
            
            <p>"No, I would rather finish."</p>
            
            <p>"Give your name to the clerk."</p>
            
            <p>I complied and was entered on his book as the resident of a vacant lot on
               Monroe street. The forewoman selected a bundle as big as a Kamschatka baby
               from a mountain of bundles and said:
            </p>
            
            <p>"Here, go over there and wait till I come."</p>
            
            <p>"How much do you pay for this class of work?"</p>
            
            <p>"I don't know. It seems to me you're mighty particular."</p>
            
            <p>"If you don't know who does?" I asked.</p>
            
            <p>"You make me dizzy," she said, dropping the bundle and giving me a look of
               intense disgust. She took a small book from her pocket containing the
               price-list and asked me what number.
            </p>
            
            <p>"I don't know."</p>
            
            <p>"Look."</p>
            
            <p>"Where?"</p>
            
            <p>"You'll come down a peg or two before long," and with a groan she bent over
               the bundle at her feet, flushed apoplectically and said "360." Referring
               again to her price-list: "Them's sixty-five cents," and left me.
            </p>
            
            <p>I raised that sixty-five cent ulster, and with my arms folded about the
               fuzzy, ill-smelling thing, moved "down there" as directed, and halted at the
               edge of a huge rag box. Here I stood for twenty minutes, when the forewoman
               came aft and bade me "this way." I pursued. There was a halt about the
               middle of the shop and I seized it for a "scoop."
            </p>
            
            <p>"How many girls have you here?"</p>
            
            <p>"Never counted them."</p>
            
            <p>"What can experienced cloak hands earn in a day?"</p>
            
            <p>"Never asked them."</p>
            
            <p>"How much of your salary is for politeness?"</p>
            
            <p>"You can sit here," pointing to a cane chair with half the  seat
               gone. "That girl with the black dress will do your stitching; the one at the
               end of the second table will bind the seams, and Annie down there in brown
               calico - she's fixing the machine now - will give you any help," and she was
               off.
            </p>
            
            <p>"I beg your pardon, did I understand you to say I would get sixty-five cents
               for making this cloak?" following her.
            </p>
            
            <p>"Now your're just a little bit too fresh. If you don't want the work, say
               so."
            </p>
            
            <p>"I do want the work but I want to know what it will pay first."</p>
            
            <p>"This is a sixty-five cent cloak. Do you get that through your head? The
               stitcher gets twenty cents, the binder gets fifteen cents, and you get
               thirty cents for finishing if the work is right. If it isn't, you get
               out."
            </p>
            
            <p>I thanked her and was alone. Here I thought lay my fortune. Thirty cents for
               making a long cloth cloak, after the seams were stitched. It had to be
               trimed down the back gores around the collar, cuffs, and pockets with mohair
               plush. The sleeves had to go in, eighteen buttons sewed on, eighteen holes
               worked, and all the seams and edges faced with black muslin. Thirty cents!
               To save my life I couldn't have finished the garment in ten hours. I was
               just reaching that conclusion when the forewoman appeared with a small book,
               two checks, and a piece of tailor's chalk as big as a dime.
            </p>
            
            <p>"Your number is 180; chalk it on all these pieces and if you lose any you
               will be fined."
            </p>
            
            <p>"How much?"</p>
            
            <p>"How much? You cheeky thing! The cost of the cloth and the cutter's time.
               That's how much. Give this check to the binder and that one to the
               stitcher."
            </p>
            
            <p>"Will you please tell me how this side gore goes?"</p>
            
            <p>"Go to Annie. I ain't here to learn you how to sew."</p>
            
            <p>"May I have a needle?"</p>
            
            <p>"Furnish your own needles."</p>
            
            
            <p>"May I have basting cotton?"</p>
            
            <p>"There aint any. You have to wait till it gets here."</p>
            
            <p>I gave a girl a penny for a needle and stole some thread from an absentee's
               stock. Then I waited fifteen minutes while the finder got through and basted
               up the seams for the stitcher. That much done I got to work on the plush.
               The forewoman passed by and told me I "was not showing enough fur. Go over
               to the sample and look at the work."
            </p>
            
            <p>She sneered when I asked her where the samples were, but a neighbor
               volunteered the information. There was no sample on the rack and I stepped
               over to inform the forewoman, who curtly told me it was none of her
               affair.
            </p>
            
            <p>"Will you please tell me how wide to make this trimming?"</p>
            
            <p>"Go to Annie."</p>
            
            <p>Poor Annie was doctoring a machine and said "in a minute." On her way to me
               three stitchers implored her to look at their miserable implements and I
               waited patiently till I caught sight of the forewoman looking at her bangs
               in a handglass. Apologizing for the intrusion I asked her if the sample had
               come yet.
            </p>
            
            <p>"No."</p>
            
            <p>"I wish you would kindly show me how wide to make this trimming."</p>
            
            <p>"Go to Annie, I told you."</p>
            
            <p>"Annie is too busy. She's mending machines."</p>
            
            <p>"Well, I won't be bothered with you."</p>
            
            <p>"What's the reason you won't?"</p>
            
            <p>"Cause I won't"</p>
            
            <p>"Well you will. Tell me how wide you want this plush or I will see Mr
               A---"
            </p>
            
            <p>"See him. I don't care. There he is," pointing to a snaky, half-starved
               creature whose shanks I had been sketching and on whom I had scornfully
               turned my back. It was too much to ask of a free-born American woman to
               recognize the superi-  ority of such a person. He came up to us
               in an instant. The forewoman was livid with rage and she began to talk as
               fast as her tongue could move. Some fifty or more girls heard the tirade
               breathlessly. Before the half-dressed proprietor had a chance to get over
               his astonishment I threw the front of the cloak at his face, the side body
               at the forewoman, and walked off to my disabled chair with Mr. A. for a
               bodyguard. He was the color of a sanitarium babe when we reached my work
               table. He had the two pieces of cloak in his hand, and when he raised his
               fist to strike me I worked up an Indian-club attitude and dared him.
            </p>
            
            <p>He escorted me to the toilet-room, where I went for my hat and jacket, and
               before slamming the door in his face by way of a hint as to the privacy of
               the place I threw my needle and thread at him. Mr. A. saw me across the shop
               and down the first flight of stairs. And there ended my first experience in
               a cloak factory.
