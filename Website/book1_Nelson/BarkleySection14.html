         <div class="articleText">
            
            <p>It was 7 a. m. by all the whistles in "Little Hell" when I reached that
               section of the city in search of an opening in a slop-shop. The streets were
               crowded with shop hands hurrying to their day's work - men and boys with
               pipes in their mouths carrying dinner-pails or lunch-baskets; little girls
               in groups of two and three, in beggarly rags; young women and old women,
               some of them white-haired and stooped with age, wearing shawls about their
               head and shoulders and the meanest apologies for shoes. Many girls were
               bare-headed, and went through the street with old skirts and dilapidated
               waists that had neither collar or sleeves.
            </p>
            
            <p>At the corner of E. and W. streets is an immense tailor shop into which the
               girls fairly swarmed, some going into the main and some into the rear
               building. Both buildings have three stories, each containing a shop under a
               different "boss." I followed the crowd through both buildings, beginning in
               the basement and going up and up and up the narrow,dirty, cov- 
               ered stairs, stopping on each floor to see the "boss" and apply for work. No
               success. The vest shops were full and so were the trousers shops. In the
               jacket shop there was room for experienced hands only at the munificent
               salary of $3 a week. The garments were cut and the sewer had the entire
               making.
            </p>
            
            <p>As I passed through the crowded rooms I could not help noticing the
               machine-like way everything was done. Not a moment was wasted in greetings
               or exchange of friendly remarks. Almost at the very instant the girls took
               their seats the machines were whizzing and whirling and the bright little
               needles flying through seams, collars, bands and facings. Cutters clicked
               their shears, and little scissors and presser sponged leg-seams and collars
               and moved their heavy "gooses" under little clouds of steaming vapor.
               Everywhere it was work, work, work, for barely enough to keep life in the
               body and virtue in the soul of these hapless children of misery.
            </p>
            
            <p>The only real luxury about these two great shops, containing in all about
               seven work-rooms and five hundred workers, was the wealth of sunlight and
               fresh air. On three sides of the buildings were windows through which the
               heavens smiled. The staircases, which, by the way, were boxed, ran along the
               right side of the building, and which, in case of fire, would have gone up
               in an instant, leaving the unfortunate inmates with absolutely no means of
               escape but the windows. I asked one of the bosses where his fire escape was,
               and he told me if I had no other business with him to "get out."
            </p>
            
            <p>All the women and girls I talked with lived at home. I was informed that only
               those living in the neighborhood were engaged, thus doing away with the
               car-fare item. Some of the little girls were paid $1 a week for tacking on
               tickets, sewing on buckles to back straps, and pulling out basting stitches.
               All other work was paid for by the piece and salaries varying from $2 to
               $10, according to the skill of the laborer,  $4 being a very
               fair average for this season of the year. The worst feature of these shops
               was the limited room. The girls sat elbow to elbow and the floor was piled
               with work half an hour after the shop opened.
            </p>
            
            <p>At 8 o'clock I went to B's shop at H. and C. street, where some evidences of
               decency were apparant. Instead of the rude timber generally put in work
               tables I found those on the main floor planed and grained. Off the shop was
               a cozy little office, and printed in three different languages were framed
               copies of rules and regulations. Quoting from the set, the employes were
               notified that the hours of work were from 7 to 12 and from 1 to 6; any one
               desiring to leave before would require a permit to do so from the office;
               any one neglecting to give the firm three days' notice prior to leaving
               would forfeit any salary due; every operator was obliged to oil and clean
               her machine in the morning before using it and in the evening after using
               it.
            </p>
            
            <p>The prices paid were miserably low. A couple of girls who "tacked" pockets
               received 80 cents a hundred, and work was kept back so that often the
               earnings did not exceed $2 a week. Once or twice $18 was received in two
               weeks. Girls who did the "flesh" basting along the leg seams of pants were
               paid $1 a hundred; 7 cents was the price paid for finishing the cheaper
               vests and 9 cents the better ones. Here I met white-haired women who sewed
               from morning till night to make $5 a week.
            </p>
            
            <p>The "boss" didn't need any help, so I tried the retail tailor store of K---
               N----, on Chicago avenue.
            </p>
            
            <p>Business is dull and we are not doing much up-stairs. You might come in next
               week if you are idle, but I'll tell you now that you can't earn over fifty
               cents a day. We are working on vests; make them all by machine. If you can
               sew well I'll give you one cent for joining the collar."
            </p>
            
            <p>Telling him he would do nothing of the kind I put into Cleveland avenue and
               came upon the genuine slop-shop. At  No. 314 I met Mrs. S. The
               family lives up-stairs in a cottage and on the ground floor is the shop,
               which is entered from the back yard via the kitchen.
            </p>
            
            <p>In the latter apartment was a splendid, big range, brightly polished. A
               couple of Swedes were pressing at a side table. In the front room were the
               machine girls, nice, healthy creatures, selected no doubt for their enduring
               quality. Nothing but the boards in the floor protected their place from the
               damp soil, and while everything was scrupulously neat the facilities for
               rheumatism were largely superior to those for health, comfort and light.
               Wages varied. Mr. S. was away, but his salary sheet was safe in his wife's
               keeping. "Some girls earn so much and some not so much, and that's how it
               is," she said. One of her oldest hands told me she worked "like a slave for
               $4.50 and never get more than $5. He won't let you."
            </p>
            
            <p>Mr. H---, of Cleveland avenue, has not mastered the English language, but
               knows all about the values of American labor, since he gets it as low as $1
               a week.
            </p>
            
            <p>His establishment is in a rear building adjoining his residence. Ascending a
               flight of wooden stairs I found myself on a landing, from which one door led
               to the H. kitchen and another down four steps to the shop. The sewers
               numbered possibly thirty, in all stages of poverty. They worked as though
               salvation depended on industry, and all the time I remained not a word was
               spoken. The girls made signs when a spool of thread or a skein of twist was
               wanted. From every window a different house was visible, some of them being
               nothing more than mere sheds, in all of which were young children and
               mothers.
            </p>
            
            <p>H. didn't want any more help. I sought him through his wife, but found him so
               sullen that out of pity for her I took an early dismissal. It made me very
               unhappy to see the poor girls slaving over their work, ruining their eyes,
               health and appearance by the faulty positions in which they sat. It needed
               no  quizzing to learn that the salaries received were very poor,
               for there was not a decent pair of shoes nor a tidy dress in the whole
               assembly.
            </p>
            
            <p>In the rear of Cleveland avenue is a two-story wood shed, on the upper floor
               of which Herr K--- and half a hundred employes work on "shop" clothing and
               make money. That is, C. makes it. At the foot of the stores leading from the
               back yard is a little kennel, from which a ferocious watch-dog bounded and
               nearly scared me into a fit. The "boss" was "out on the front sidewalk" the
               foreman told me. He offered to call him, but I protested, and, seating
               myself on the edge of a press-stand, surveyed the room. Girls all around
               sewing with slavish speed and convict silence. Everything silent as the tomb
               but the trembling machines. Girls in calico rags and woolen rags and one
               with a neat little three-cent cotton suit and a pink ribbon about her neck.
               A child of a dozen years or so goes round the room with drinking-water. The
               four men wear slippers and clay pipes and press without ceasing the cheap
               John and cottony pants and vests. All the windows are wide open and at the
               very level of their sills I count the roofs of seven foul-smelling
               closets.
            </p>
            
            <p>K. is middle-aged, with a complexion like pork tenderloin and a limited
               knowledge of English. He manages to make me understand that I have no show,
               and I make my farewell appearance and open at S.'s on Mohawk street. That
               gentleman uses his wife for a mouth-piece and his kitchen for a factory.
               Only three girls at work. Rest have laid off till next week. They have
               pantaloons for the millions about the room, stacked in piles of five feet
               high, for finishing which girls get 6 cents, or 30 cents a day.
            </p>
            
            <p>At Eugenie street I find another shop in which the girls are packed like
               cattle in a freight car. The "boss" doesn't want to try me and I'm glad of
               it.
            </p>
            
            <p>I take a walk down Larrabee street. At O.'s on S. street  near S.
               I am "taken." It is just 12 o'clock. I have been tramping through "Little
               Hell" and vicinity since 7 o'clock and feel completely "done." I take a rest
               till 12:30 and explore the shop. The building is a story and a half,
               extending back to the alley, with a frontage of forty feet. In the basement
               is a livery stable. Mr. O keeps three or more steeds here and rents out a
               stall or two to a neighbor. Off the stable is a closet for the hands. On the
               floor above the stables are quarters for twenty odd men and women in a
               dirty, dark, gloomy place, with bare rafters and smoke-stained, unfinished
               walls. The machine-tables are set along the window-line, leaving the center
               of the floor for a blazing furnace that supplies the power, and mountains of
               pants ready to be finished. Near the roaring fire is a sink supplied with
               nothing but a faucet. When it was time to go home my face and hands were
               coated with dust and dye, but there was neither, soap nor towel with which
               to make myself decent and I had to go unwashed. The upper floor had a
               slanting roof in which windows had been cut to admit the necessary, although
               by no means sufficient light. The heat was simply enfeebling. Before I had
               half started my No. 338 I was inclined to throw down the gauntlet and go
               home, but the patient, uncomplaining, suffering girls made me ashamed of
               myself, and I resolved to hold on. The perspiration rolled down their arms
               and faces and stained the miserable waists they wore at the neck and
               shoulders.
            </p>
            
            <p>"Yes, it's awful hot up here," my neighbor remarked, "but this is nothing to
               the cold. In the winter we work with our cloaks on always till noon, and
               lots of times I have kept my overshoes on all day."
            </p>
            
            <p>The "boss" made me equivocate about my knowledge of the pantaloon trade.</p>
            
            <p>"I can't take any but experienced help."</p>
            
            <p>"How much?"</p>
            
            
            <p>"Where have you worked?"</p>
            
            <p>"Oh, at G's, and J. S's, and E's and - "</p>
            
            <p>"Have you done tailoring?"</p>
            
            <p>"Plenty."</p>
            
            <p>"Well, then, if you're experienced you ought to be worth considerable. Here,
               take that for a sample," and he handed me a pair of No. 33 striped
               pantaloons with a roll of red and white waistbands and sent me up stairs,
               where, between the stable smell and the enervating atmosphere, I came near
               collapsing.
            </p>
            
            <p>I hadn't the faintest idea of how to go about the waist of the garment, but I
               watched the "boss" down-stairs and got Matson to let me sit by him. The dear
               old man was bald and untidy, but he basted in the body lining for me,
               chalked the buttons on the waistband and fly, and did my ripping - which was
               not trifling. It was 12:30 when I began, and I worked every moment of the
               time with a diligence that was positively criminal till the work was done.
               It was 4:45 when I handed my first pair of factory trousers to the "boss,"
               who looked them over from bottoms to buttons, and said: "You'll do the
               others better."
            </p>
            
            <p>"Yes sir. How much?"</p>
            
            <p>"Five cents."</p>
            
            <p>How is that for American labor? Five cents for four hour's work!</p>
            
            <p>I was told by the women who take them home that four pair are as many as they
               can finish in a day. That is 20 cents, or $1.20 a week. But oh, the smell of
               that cellar stable, and the heat and the wan faces of the girls that make
               hideous the very name of O.
