            <p>At R--- &amp; Co’s and R--- Bros. I applied for work and was told to report
               in the morning to sew on cloaks.
            </p>
            
            <p>The manager in S’s on Market street wanted hands and offered to engage me at
               once. I was most impudently catechised, some seven inquiries requiring as
               many false statements. What was my name, place of residence, last position,
               amount of wages received, state of my health, nativity, married or  single - to which I answered "neither." Here was a dilemma.
            </p>
            
            <p>"Oh, yes, widow? " and an inordinate ha! ha!</p>
            
            <p>"Yes."</p>
            
            <p>"Grass widow, eh?" with a sneer.</p>
            
            <p>"How much do you pay for cloaks", I asked, tired of the ordeal.</p>
            
            <p>"Fifty c«nts each."</p>
            
            <p>It was enough and I left the creature still anxious to solve the widow
               question.
            </p>
            
            <p>By the time I reached L’s on Market street, I was in a reckless frame of
               mind.
            </p>
            
            <p>"Is there any work for a good sewer?" I asked the girl in the office.</p>
            
            <p>"Yes, plenty. John give her some pants."</p>
            
            <p>John had eyes the color of calico, and a complexion like an immature tomato.
               He led the way to the cottonades, which were cut, trimmed, and tied up in
               bundles of a dozen garments each.
            </p>
            
            <p>"Here’s a sample," holding up a pair of overalls of brown cottonade. "The
               work is cut out, but you will have to do everything yourself. I want you to
               make the fly extra strong and press the bottoms. We pay 75 cents a dozen and
               you find your own thread."
            </p>
            
            <p>"Seventy-five cents for a dozen of these pants and find my own thread?"</p>
            
            <p>"Yes, or I’ll give you 80 cents a dozen and give you linen thread if you sew
               the buttons on fast."
            </p>
            
            <p>"No, I guess, I won’t take the pants. What other work have you?"</p>
            
            <p>"Here are cheviot shirts, if you'd rather. Gusset the tail here and the
               sleeves, stay the bosom and arm-holes, and make the collar and wristbands
               extra strong. These pay 75 cents a dozen." He offered to give me three on
               trial. The thread cost 5 cents, car-fare 10 cents, and I should have left 3
               cents after the job.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>John said: "That’s so, but I can’t help it. If the work is satisfactory you
               can have a six-dozen lot."
            </p>
            
            <p>It was very good for John to sympathize with me, but I thanked him and said I
               would look a little further.
