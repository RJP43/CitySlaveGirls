            <p>One of the white slaves of Chicago stood in the prisoner's
               dock at the armory police court yesterday, moaning piteously.
               She was young and her face was pretty. The big policeman
               who stood at her side said he had arrested her for soliciting
               men upon the street. She was booked as Kitty Kelly. The
               frail, unfortunate girl brushed away her tears and told a story
               that went straight to the heart of every man in the crowded
               court-room. She was a white slave and might have worn
               away her frail life sewing that her character should remain
               pure and unsullied, but the grinning skeleton of starvation
               haunted her by day and night, and in desperation she sold herself to the tempter.
               She w'as pale and thin and fierce hunger
               had left marks upon her young face.
            </p>
            
            <p>"Oh, judge, I never did such a thing before! I never did
               it before! For God's sake have pity on me!" and she wrung
               her hands in agony and sobbed convulsively.
            </p>
            
            <p>"Nonsense," said the justice, trying to be stern. "You all
               say that."
            </p>
            
            <p>"My baby! my baby! Oh what will become of her? For
               mercy's sake don't fine me! I have no money, not a cent.
               Oh have mercy. I never was out before, surely I never was!"
            </p>
            
            <p>The big justice looked inquiringly at the big officer and the
               big officer with a touch of emotion in his voice, said:
            </p>
            
            
            <p>"I never saw her before, your honor."</p>
            
            <p>"Will you promise to keep off the street?"</p>
            
            <p>"I can't, no I can't promise you that. God knows I would
               if I could. But when I see my baby starving and there is no
               other way to find food for her, what else can I do?" and the
               wretched little woman sobbed as if her heart was breaking.
               The justice looked stern.
            </p>
            
            <p>"Oh sir," she sobbed, "if you only knew the misery and
               sorrow, the despair and degradation to which I have been
               humiliated, you might pity me. I was young when I
               was married. For a while I was so happy. Then my
               husband sickened and died. That was but little more
               than a year ago. Soon after my baby was born. I had
               no friends and no money. I was alone in this great city and
               no one to help me or even to give me a bit of advice. Vainly
               I sought for work. I could not go into service and take my
               baby with me, and I could not bear the thought of parting
               from it. At last I found employment in a factory. There I
               made overalls and toiled from morning until night, week in
               and week out. But work as hard as I could, I could only
               earn four dollars a week. Baby took sick and I had to pay
               for a doctor and medicine and it cost more than I could make."
            </p>
            
            <p>Starvation or a life of shame, she said, were the only two
               courses she could see, and for the baby's sake she chose shame.
               But such a life was full of horror for her, and, disgusted and
               ashamed, she went back to the old grinding toil. Striving
               with all her power to earn an honest livelihood she again saw
               that the struggle was too much, and two weeks ago she saw
               that her baby must starve unless she found something else.
               She went upon the street and was placed in the station. She
               was moaning and sobbing, and though imprisonment seemed
               probable, she only thought of her little girl.
            </p>
            
            <p>"It was all because of my baby. She is my all and I can't
               send her to the Home for the Friendless. I worked hard for
               
               her but we could not live with only four dollars a week.
               What could I do? I could not beg enough for both. Oh, I
               was driven to it, and after I had sunk once, I could get nothing
               else than the factory because I had no one who would give me
               a letter of recommendation. It was starvation for my baby,
               or shame."
            </p>
            
            <p>"But many I know manage to live on less than four dollars
               a week," said the magistrate.
            </p>
            
            <p>"Yes, one person might; but I can't feed, clothe, and shelter my baby and myself for
               that. Must I lose my baby
               because a woman cannot earn more than enough in Chicago
               to give herself black bread and a garret?"
            </p>
            
            <p>She claimed that she was not on the downward path of her
               own volition, and that if she could support herself and child
               she would leave her life of shame. She was fined twenty-five
               dollars, but execution was staid during good behavior. If
               arrested again she will be given fifty days at the bridewell.
               She left the court-room weeping and moaning.
            </p>
            
            <p>"What will become of my baby," she cried, "if I am
               brought here and have to be imprisoned for so long?"
            </p>
