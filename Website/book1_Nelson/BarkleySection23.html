            <p>Nothing short of a Philadelphia lawyer, a Chicago health officer, a
               proprietor or a "devil-chaser" that hits the spot once in a thousand times
               could, without a guide, explore the labyrinth that is known as H. S. &amp;
               Co.'s paper-box manufactory, on R--- street. It occupies only the three
               upper floors of a four-story building, but the stairways are so dark and
               narrow that one must grope his way from somewhere to a suppositious
               somewhere else, which resembles nowhere when he gets there, because the
               rooms are so overcrowded with material that one employe cannot in many
               instances see her nearest neighbor two yards away.
            </p>
            
            <p>Of the 120 employes, ten are mere girls, who get from $2 to $3 a week, while
               the others receive from $5 to $7.50. Each girl keeps her own account-book,
               and at the request of the proprietor submitted it to inspection. It showed
               the exact amount the owner had been paid each week for many weeks. One
               advantage of working in this stuffy place is that there is work the year
               around.
            </p>
            
            <p>Mr. S. had the usual explanation to make as to the employment of young boys
               and girls and no doubt made it truthfully.
            </p>
            
            <p>Their parents needed their assistance and would sign any  sort
               of certificate as to age, and supplement it with personal solicitation
               asking employment as a charity. In extreme cases he negotiated a compromise
               with his judgment, as most manufacturers do, and gave the child
               employment.
            </p>
            
            <p>"What kind of work do you do?" A group of five boys was asked at the noon
               hour.
            </p>
            
            <p>"All but him binds packages; he glues."</p>
            
            <p>"How old are you?"</p>
            
            <p>"We's pretty old and gettin' older all de time."</p>
            
            <p>The closets are separate and fairly decent.</p>
            
            <p>The ventilation is bad.</p>
            
            <p>"I am a man of few words and you have no time to lose, so I will proceed
               direct to business. Do you want to get married?"
            </p>
            
            <p>The proposition was made by a Times reporter to an attractive young woman
               employed as a seamstress in a custom shop on the fourth floor of S. N's
               building on the southwest corner of W. and H. streets on the North side.
            </p>
            
            <p>The reporter had seen the young woman but once before, and after that meeting
               the following paragraph was printed in The Times on August 13:
            </p>
            
            <p>"An intelligent trio, evidently good friends, gathered in a corner, and
               between bites talked freely. One was a thorough American, lived on May
               street, and walked back and forth from her work, the round distance being
               fully three miles. Another, whose yellow hair bespoke an ancestry from the
               region of the midnight sun, walked about the same distance. Many an avenue
               belle would give half her inheritance, for the form, face and figure, to say
               nothing of the brains of this every-day sewing girl, wearing out her young
               life for $6 a week. But she made no complaints. Independence more than
               compensated her for the hardships of the weary day."
            </p>
            
            <p>Usually "popping the question" is a trying ordeal to a man, even when none
               but the two parties most interested are present.  What must it
               have been in this case when half a score of pairs of bright eyes were gazing
               in astonishment and as many ears were trained to catch every syllable?
               Usually, too, the woman addressed is very much embarrassed, or seems to be.
               This one was not. With a musical laugh followed by an interrogation point,
               she awaited further developments, Emma, the American girl, rallying her
               good-naturedly the while
            </p>
            
            <p>"You know you want to get married," said Emma. "Why don't you say yes?"</p>
            
            <p>Not wishing to prolong the agony beyond the proper limit the reporter
               produced the following letter:
            </p>
            
            <p>Chicago, Aug. 13. - To the Editor: One who reads your articles with more than
               passing interest, and who deeply sympathizes with the cause of honest labor,
               has sufficient romance in his "make-up" to perform his part in assisting the
               young lady of brains referred to, and if honesty of purpose, good bringing
               up, etc., accompany the brains, the lady can find at the head of an honest,
               temperate, working-man's home a peace and comfort not found in "wearing out
               her young life" in pursuit of a mere existence. This is in good faith, and
               any acknowledgment of it will call forth - confidentially, of course - the
               name and address of the writer.
            </p>
            
            <p>It was interesting to watch the play of the girl's features as she read the
               letter. At first curiosity was uppermost; then came an expression of sadness
               as the passages expressing sympathy for honest labor were reached, and
               finally a slight flush and a smile as she read the offering clause.
            </p>
            
            <p>"Will you accept?"</p>
            
            <p>"Don't you do it at once," said Emma, tantalizingly.</p>
            
            <p>"Keep him waiting for a while till he gets real anxious."</p>
            
            <p>"Who is the writer?" asked the girl to whom the letter referred. " He must
               live where girls are scarce."
            </p>
            
            <p>"The letter is dated and postmarked 'Chicago.'"</p>
            
            <p>"Well, I should like to see the writer. It takes something more than
               temperance and honesty to make a man. I shall not embrace the present
               opportunity to answer."
            </p>
            
            
            <p>"Nor the man either?"</p>
            
            <p>"Nor the man either," she said with a merry laugh as she caught the gentler
               force of the play upon the words.
            </p>
            
            <p>"Will you answer the letter?"</p>
            
            <p>"I will take it under advisement, as politicians say"</p>
            
            <p>"If you don't accept turn the letter over to me," chimed in Emma. And then
               noticing the grounds in her coffee she added: "Can you tell fortunes?"
            </p>
            
            <p>Everybody on the Times tells fortunes, and of course the visitor could. "This
               man is a blonde, tall, somewhat portly, and a widower with three children,"
               he began.
            </p>
            
            <p>"Can't you make it five? She just dotes on children. If she won't take him
               I'll be No. 2 and run the chance. Can't you induce him to call here? We are
               tailoresses here, but when we appear upon the street we are ---"
            </p>
            
            <p>"Well, what are we then?" asked the girl with the light hair.</p>
            
            <p>"Why, then - then we are ourselves. What time is it?"</p>
            
            <p>"Seventeen minutes to 1 o'clock."</p>
            
            <p>"Then we have just two minutes to live," and the trio began preparations for
               renewing their toil after the forty-five minutes allowed for lunch. The
               author of the letter might wait a long time before finding a brighter or
               better head for his household than this girl whose ancestors worshipped Thor
               and Woden.
            </p>
            
            <p>"Nell Nelson," in a recent article in the Times, described the trousers
               manufactory of K. B. O., on S. street near Division, as a two-story and
               basement frame, the stories being used for girls and the basement for
               horses. This is true as to the girls, and only the qualifying expression "in
               part" is needed to make it fit the basement, the rear portion of it being
               used for stabling, with all that the word implies. Miss Nelson, it will be
               remembered, worked an afternoon at this place, making a pair of trousers for
               5 cents, and after relating her experience quoted  the words of
               a young woman who sat at the same table and who complained that the shop was
               cold.
            </p>
            
            <p>Of course the girl had no idea that her language was to appear in print and
               spoke carelessly. But Mr. O. was displeased and the girl was promptly
               discharged from his employ. The Knights of Labor were promptly notified and
               so was the Times. Yesterday a reporter was instructed to investigate the
               case and if the facts were as reported to assure the girl, whose name is
               Mary Kane, that the Times would secure for her another and better
               position.
            </p>
            
            <p>Mr. O. was found on the upper floor of his shop and pretty mad yet, though he
               had had a week to cool off in. But he soon quieted down, led the way to the
               office in the basement, and sent for Foreman M. Then the Times article was
               read and liberally commented on, M. doing most of the talking because he
               could turn sharp corners in English a trifle more skillfully than O.
            </p>
            
            <p>"Mary Kane has left, but she wasn't exactly discharged," said O. "If the
               rooms are cold in winter why didn't she complain to me instead of 'Nell
               Nelson?' I know they are cold at times, but not for half a day. I frequently
               feel chilly myself in the early morning. I know the house is not a model; It
               was built directly after the fire and needs many improvements. Why didn't
               Mary Kane complain to me?"
            </p>
            
            <p>"She preferred no charges against you. In a casual way she stated to a
               table-mate that the shop was cold in winter as you now acknowledge. The
               situation is this: If you have discharged Mary Kane because of a chance
               word, The Times will see to it that she immediately secures a situation in
               some other shop."
            </p>
            
            <p>After a few moments Mr. O. said the girl was one of the best in his employ,
               that nothing could be said against her work or her character, and he would
               be willing to take her back.
            </p>
            
            <p>"You may tell Mary K. she may come back to work if she  wishes
               to. I don't want to do anybody any injustice. All I had against her in all
               the years she worked for me was that remark about my shop being cold."
            </p>
            
            <p>"But I may not see her, as she is away from home"</p>
            
            <p>"Well, just go over and tell her mother that it's all right and Mary can go
               to work when she likes."
            </p>
            
            <p>It was the work of an hour, but no bull-dozing or pleading was used. The case
               was squarely discussed on its merits, and if Mary K., whom all the
               neighbors, including O. himself, say is a steady, industrious, and
               thoroughly deserving girl, walks into the shop to-day she can have her old
               seat and at the same time the consciousness that she has not compromised
               herself or been compromised in the least. Both O. and M. will be glad to
               welcome her back, which is much to their credit.
