            <p>Never so long as reason reigns shall I forget the day I worked in H. G.'s
               tailor-shop, and never when I pray shall I forget to add "God help the shop
               girls."
            </p>
            
            
            <p>Thursday morning I stepped from an Ogden avenue car and walked down Market
               street in search of work. It was broiling hot and I carried my brown veil on
               the breeze, and a small pasteboard box containing a cracker and a lemon, a
               paper of needles, a thimble, and a pair of scissors. On the way I met two
               unhappy looking girls of whom I made labor inquiry. One had sewed carpet at
               five dollars a week for the C. C. Co. but was out of employment. The other
               said she earned six dollars a week in Wilson Brothers' cravat department.
               Her cousin was sick and the forewoman had "let her off for the day."
            </p>
            
            <p>The first clew I got to a place was a wooden sign with "Sewing Girls Wanted"
               that hung below the north window of 155 Market street, where Messrs. H---,
               A---; &amp; M--- manufacture clothing. I read the sign and entered the main
               store - a nice, big, clean, cool place. A little girl sat at the big
               typewriter making such a clatter with her letters that it was useless to try
               to call her. In the office were two gentlemen. One was the very prototype of
               Munkacsy's Jesus Christ and he I addressed for work.
            </p>
            
            <p>"The gentleman that attends to the work is not here just at present. Take a
               seat a moment." I thanked him and looked at the vacant chair. It wouldn't
               do. It was too conspicuous. I knew the credit man in the building opposite
               and didn't care to be seen in my factory togs, so I went in a dark corner,
               where I stood, first on one foot and then on 'tother, for exactly forty
               minutes. Nobody came. Finally he with the Nazarene face appeared and said :
               "Ill go up and see if we want any more help." Again I said "Thank you," and
               watched him as he walked to the back of the store.
            </p>
            
            <p>No, he didn't have a halo, but a monstrous pair of pedal extremities that
               curled up like an old-fashioned skate.
            </p>
            
            <p>When he got to the back of the store he simply retraced his steps and told me
               "We have all the girls we need."
            </p>
            
            
            <p>"Why don't you take your sign in then? I have lost an hour."</p>
            
            <p>A sneer made his face so hideous that I apologized to the Hungarian
               painter.
            </p>
            
            <p>"Supposing you take it in," he said following me to the doorstep.</p>
            
            <p>"Why should I?"</p>
            
            <p>"And for what purpose, please, should I take that sign in?"</p>
            
            <p>"For Christain charity, but Christain charity is not in your line."</p>
            
            <p>I then went over to Messrs. S. L. and Co. There I encountered the manager of
               the work-room and the most contemptuous treatment it was possible for a man
               to show a hapless woman. Suffice it to say H. A. &amp; M. were avenged.
            </p>
            
            <p>At A. L. S. &amp; Co.'s, 178 Market street, I received the most courteous
               consideration. The manager took my name, or rather a name and address, and
               said he would give it to any of his patrons who needed help. Then he wrote
               me a letter of which the following is a copy:
            </p>
            
            <p>H. G---- Rumsey street - Sir: This girl wants work. I don't know what she can
               do, but I think you can use her. Respectfully, A. L. S.---- per S---.
            </p>
            
            <p>Rumsey street is two blocks west of Ashland avenue. It begins at Division
               street and runs south a quarter of a mile or so over heaps of yellow clay,
               rubbish and holes. The road is almost impassable for teams, and only the
               residents of the locality can take the upheavals and depressions of the
               sidewalk for a block without getting sea-sick. Filth of every description
               litters the ground, and following the line where a curbstone should be, are
               garbage-boxes where the children mold mud pies during the day where the men
               sit and smoke their pipes after the day's work is done, and where now and
               then old termagants back-bite their neigbors and tear each other's hair.
               Some of the cottages are so low that the chim-  neys barely
               reach above grade, and all swarm with children, pale, eager, dirty little
               creatures that root about in the yellow clay and fresh
               dumpngs like the dogs they play
               with. Poor children, it is not their mothers' fault that they are wild and
               unkept, for the languid parents give all their strength to the shop-work in
               order to half feed and partly clothe them. I had only walked a few blocks in
               this deep-rutted street in search of H. G---- before being convinced that I
               was not in the district of protuberant optimists.
            </p>
            
            <p>The first woman I made inquiry of was carrying a bucket of sawdust from a
               neighboring ale-house. She didn't know the name, but when I mentioned coats
               she grew loquacious.
            </p>
            
            <p>"Oh, yes, the 'slave hole' it's called; that's the sheeny tailor's! Don't go
               to him, my dear; he'll grind the marrow from your bones. Go to service,
               girl, go to service. You can have a cot in my room till you find a place. I
               was with him one fortnight and worked my eyes most blind and he paid me
               $1.75. No, I m from England, but I never had harder times in the old country
               than now. There I paid five shillings for lodgings and here they cost me
               four dollars." She told me she got the sawdust for sweeping out a corner
               dram-shop and used it to boil her tea-kettle with.
            </p>
            
            <p>The grandeur of 258 quite over-powered me. Instead of a "hole" I found myself
               entering a large two-story red brick house still in process of construction.
               I ascended the front steps, and after the maneuver of the celebrated king of
               France marched down again to the basement - to the shop - into the presence
               of Mr. H. G---. I handed him my letter and while he read it I took him in -
               optically. He was an unctious little fellow with kinky hair, cunning brown
               eyes, hatchet features, and a small mustache the color of roasted coffee. He
               was attired in two shirts - a nether one of chocolate flannel and a linen
               one a few shades lighter - a pair of check pantaloons, carpet slippers, and
               a huge gold ring of masonic design.  He read the letter with the
               cigar in his mouth, the smell of which combined with the flavor of his feet
               and the exhalations of his toilel was something preponderant.
            </p>
            
            <p>He asked me what I had worked at, and after a few gasps I gave him some of my
               history slightly distorted.
            </p>
            
            <p>I was told to take off my hat and while doing so he stepped back out in the
               entry and vacated a hook among the factory girl's wraps, but as I did not
               care to take the chances of tempting the gutter snipes and going home
               bare-headed I declined his attention and hung them in a corner on the floor.
               All ready, sewing box in hand, I faced the gaping, silent throng, and was
               pointed to a chair at a long table, about which ten girls were sewing with a
               speed and a silence that was terrible to contemplate. They wore cotton
               dresses of the poorest quality, some of them open at the neck and nearly all
               rolled to the elbow. The youngest were four little girls of it, one of whom
               was operating, two basting, and the fourth finishing a blue cloth cloak. One
               large Irish hand, possibly 25, sat at the upper end of the table. Of the
               rest, 15 years would be a fair average age. One poor girl who was very lame
               had a machine, and it made my heart ache fo watch her pale face and follow
               her thin little hands guide coat after coat under the needle. All the girls
               were thin and haggered, some were very pretty, some few had color in their
               cheeks, but it was the hectic flush, not the healthy glow of youth and
               physical strength.
            </p>
            
            <p>In all we were twenty girls, eight men and two boys - poor young fellows in
               their teens, with mealy complexions, wild eyes, hollow cheeks and sunken
               chests. Neither weighed a hundred pounds, but both pressed goods with heavy
               irons and were cuffed and pushed about by the boss and his assistant. The
               men worked in slippers and undershirt without straps or suspenders to keep
               their trousers in place, and the girls wore heavy peg shoes. I noticed some
               of the machine hands worked the foot-plate in their Stocking feet.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>I had taken all this in when the boss came near my chair and threw a plaid
               sack coat in my lap and without a word walked away. Here was a nice
               predicament I thought, as I looked the galley over. I asked the little
               yellow-haired Swede girl at my right where to begin, but she looked at me
               and resumed her "feeling" without a word of reply. Then I asked a big,
               yellow-haired, dough-faced German girl on my left and received the same kind
               of response. Instantly I realized their position. Compulsory silence.
            </p>
            
            <p>I put twist in my needle, squeezed on my thimble and selected a side-seam in
               the farmer satin lining, for if there is any one kind of needle work that I
               pride myself on it is "felling." Well, I felled an hour, up one seem and
               down another, around the collar and along the bottom of the coat. Then I
               stitched and tacked the tail pockets, took a deep breath and settled back in
               my chair to take a rest. I didn't take it long, though. Before I could reel
               off two lines of Hood's "Song of the Shirt" the boss was at my elbow looking
               over my work with his nasty smelly cigar so near my face that I was obliged
               to pull back to escape being burned.
            </p>
            
            <p>"Take smaller stitches," he said. "Don't 'fell' through. You havn't though.
               Now put in the sleeve-lining," and he left me muttering inwardly, "put in
               the sleeve-lining." I did. In a great deal less time I was told to rip it
               out. I put it in a second time and a second time did Penelope's work. The
               third time was not a charm, and when his unctions honor, who had been
               watching me all the time, neared my chair I politely asked him to show me
               how to arrange the fullness. He grabbed the coat, shook the "muffy" thing in
               my face, dropped the ashes from his two-for-a-nickel in my hair and
               observed: "I don't think you'll do. I want experienced hands," and though
               mute I thought: "You monster, to talk about experienced hands and pay $3.50
               a week?"
            </p>
            
            <p>Well, he showed me how tailors put in sleeve linings, and I 
               showed the merits of his teaching. In future I shall never let a coat-sleeve
               go about my waist without wanting its owner to unbutton and let me see where
               the lining is fulled and how the top seam is felled.
            </p>
            
            <p>At noon we had forty minutes for - I will not say dinner, because no one had
               anything that could be so designated, unless it were "Boss" G. and he went
               home. Most of the men had nothing to eat. I only saw two with a lunch. The
               girls had black bread and a can of cold coffee, which they consumed with
               evident relish. Not more than five minutes were spent over the repast. I
               devoured my crackers and gnawed at my lemon by way of dessert. In a hurry to
               get at my work as soon as possible to make up for lost time I threw the
               sucked Messina under the table and in a few moments saw a little stitcher
               pick it up and hide it in her pocket.
            </p>
            
            <p>By a series of questions I got the following information from a pretty Jewess
               who had been in the shop for three years and was getting $3.50 a week. She
               said regarding the salary: "Oh, I don't care. G. won't pay any more. My
               mother has money and doesn't mind so long as I learn to sew. I am 15 in
               October. I came here at 12, and don't know how much longer I will have to
               stay. G. thinks women are cows, that they must be driven. So he drives us.
               We have to be at work at 7 in the morning and stay till 6 in the
               evening."
            </p>
            
            <p>"Half holiday Saturday?"</p>
            
            <p>"Nix."</p>
            
            <p>"What if you are sick?"</p>
            
            <p>"If you're sick he 'pulls' you. He 'pulled' me for twenty cents for being
               late last week. He 'pulls' all the hands when they come late, and he 'pulls'
               if we talk."
            </p>
            
            <p>That's why I could not get my neighbors to tell me how to start my work.</p>
            
            <p>Rosy told me that she was thirteen, that her father peddled fish, and that
               she was the eldest of five sisters and two broth-  ers. She had
               been in the shop two years and was getting $2.25 a week.
            </p>
            
            <p>Another girl whom I dare not indicate said: These beggarly Jews and Swedes
               are robbing honest girls of a living. Most of them have homes and are
               willing to work for nothing. I live with my mother and brother and can not
               make any more than enough to pay our rent, $16 a month. I would go in a
               family, but my mother needs me; she is sick. G. is an awful hard man to work
               for. He steals my hire from me and I steal his cotton and silk whenever I
               get a chance."
            </p>
            
            <p>During the noon hour the girls played in the front street and afterward
               amused themselves in the back yard with the men. At 12:45 o'clock the "boss"
               came into the shop, and five minutes later the place was noisy with flying
               shuttles, clicking needles, and the whizzing wheels of the roaring
               machinery. Fair young heads and pretty shoulders bent over heavy coats, and
               faces were so low that they almost touched the sewing in their owners' laps.
               The clatter of the machines was deafening, and every now and then the shop
               resounded with the heavy hot-irons wielded by the pressers in the back room.
               Nobody had any time to hand the work, instead of which the cutter threw it
               to the trimmer, who in turn threw it to the baster, and so it moved from
               hand to machine, going the round of the thirty odd workers with such
               rapidity that the air seemed filled with flying coats. The room was low, and
               with every passage of coat-tail muffy clouds of lint seemed floating about
               in space. Add to that poor light, bad ventilation, the exhalations of so
               many people, the smell of dye from the cloth, and the noxious odor of that
               ever-consuming cigar and you have material for the make-up of Mr. G.'s coat
               shop. All afternoon we sewed; sewed incessantly without uttering a syllable
               or resting a moment. G. was building the third story of the house, and every
               hour or so he left the shop in care of an assistant and went up to look
               after the carpenters. During these intermittent spells  the
               girls took advantage of the substitute and hummed. They didn't sing, they
               hummed songs and hymns, marches and waltzes, and when the sub was not
               looking they actually whispered.
            </p>
            
            <p>But the absentee possessed marvelous powers of ubiquitousness and very little
               time was wasted in this manner. There are some people you would always know
               were in the room without seeing them. This hard-headed, godless little Jew
               was a character of that sort. We could feel his presence and a corresponding
               heaviness of atmosphere. Whenever he caught sight of a momentary idler he
               would glide up to her elbow and mutter a single verb - work! She worked.
            </p>
            
            <p>At five o'clock I was so tired that I didn't know what to do with myself. My
               hair was matted with moisture and dusted with lint, and my head throbbed
               with pain.
            </p>
            
            <p>I perspired at every pore, and the steels in my corsets rusted all the front
               of my nice Hamburg underwaist. I threw the big brown chinchilla overcoat I
               had finished on the floor and for a period of three minutes fell into a
               state of voluptuous inertia. With my sixth sense I saw the "boss" pick up
               the garment and the next moment another overcoat came flying across the
               table and dropped all over me. I threaded my needle preparatory to finishing
               my ninth garment, began a light calisthenic movement of my right arm to
               scatter the pain and limber up my elbow. I went through perhaps seven
               motions, with my chair tilted back by way of stretching my lower
               extremities, when I was interrupted by the benevolent young tailor and his
               incombustible cigar.
            </p>
            
            <p>Grabbing the frame of my chair he jammed it down on all fours and told me to
               "get to work."
            </p>
            
            <p>"How much am I going to get for this work?" I inquired, after recovering'from
               my astonishment and the sudden shock of gravitation.
            </p>
            
            <p>"Do you want to know?" he asked with a contemptibly significant laugh.</p>
            
            
            <p>"If you please."</p>
            
            <p>"Well, just finish that coat and at 6 o'clock I'll tell you."</p>
            
            <p>"I won't finish any more. There's your coat. Pay me."</p>
            
            <p>"Pay you! For what?"</p>
            
            <p>"For seven hours' work. For finishing eight coats."</p>
            
            <p>Without further notice of me than an insolent sneer he picked up the coat,
               walked back to his cutting-board and began to draft out collars. I went back
               to the cutting-board, too, and stood at his side till commanded to "get out
               of his way." I stepped back enough to give him elbow room, but did not leave
               the table.
            </p>
            
            <p>"How long do you expect to annoy me by your presence?"</p>
            
            <p>"I expect to remain where I am till you pay me for my seven hour's work."</p>
            
            <p>"Your day isn't up yet. We don't quit till 6 o'clock and its only ten minutes
               after 5."
            </p>
            
            <p>I told him I didn't want to work for him another minute and demanded my
               pay.
            </p>
            
            <p>"Well, do you want to know what I'd pay you?"</p>
            
            <p>"Yes."</p>
            
            <p>"One dollar and fifty cents a week, and you ain't worth seventy-five
               cents."
            </p>
            
            <p>"You told me when I started that I could get $3 at least if I could sew.</p>
            
            <p>"And you can't. All day you have been sitting up in your chair with your
               shoulders straight and your chair back as if you had a rocking chair.
               There's what I value you at," and he threw a 25-cent piece at me. At first I
               hesitated about touching the money, and, as I looked at him to see whether
               he was serious or not my eyes rested on the heavy, gold ring he wore.
            </p>
            
            <p>"Oh, you're a B'nai B'rith man I see. Will you favor me with your card?"</p>
            
            <p>"What for?"</p>
            
            
            <p>"I want to send this money to the society for the orphans you represent, with
               my compliments."
            </p>
            
            <p>"Get out of this shop or I'll put you out."</p>
            
            <p>Begging him not to go to that trouble I got. On my way out I took my box
               containing my sewing weapons from the table, and before I had gone two yards
               the humane proprietor of the establishment challanged me.
            </p>
            
            <p>I made a pert remark about scorning to take any of his belongings that were
               not disinfected and proceeded toward the door, behind which I had stowed my
               hat and jacket. Debating whether I had better take in the vest cellar on the
               corner of Rumsey and Division streets or go back to the office and write my
               copy I stood at a machine table and tossed up my day's earnings. The first
               was heads, the second heads, and before I could reckon the third the angry
               boss informed me in an orotund quality of voice that "that's good American
               money and if you don't want it just hand it back to me." Not deigning to
               notice the man I pinned on my hat, and this worthy member of the
               slave-driving fraternity used the opportunity every low-lived wretch has to
               insult a friendless, helpless working- girl. It may gratify H. G. to know
               thaf his cowardice had the desired effect. But I told him he would hear from
               me again and I mean to keep my word. I know personally several members of
               the B'nai B'rith, and I am sure that they at least do not know the character
               of this man, if they know he is a member.
            </p>
            
            <p>Watever opinions I may have entertained about the dignity of labor,
               respectable poverty and the absurdity of fine feathers, my experience as a
               factory hand has unfitted me for future service, since in no place that I
               worked did I see any incentive to decency, honesty or respectability, or any
               promise of success that did not carry with it the downfall of blindly
               climbing hope.
