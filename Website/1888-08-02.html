         <div class="articleText">
            
            <p>On Thursday morning when I started to renew my factory life I discovered after getting on a South-side car that I did not have a cent in my pocket. In putting on my shop-girl disguise I had left my purse at home. When the conductor asked for the fair I had none to give him. It was very hot, the clouds threatened rain, and the shop was at so great a distance that I did not feel as if I could walk. I concluded to throw myself on the generosity of the conductor and told him I had forgotten my purse. He looked ugly and told me to get off. Just as he placed his whistle to his lips to signal the gripman to stop a distinguished, well-dressed man paid my fare. I thanked him for his courtesy and told him if he would give me his card I would send him the money he had so kindly paid.</p>
            
            <p>He smiled and said: "<span class="male"><i>A mere bagatelle miss, and not worth mentioning.</i></span>"
            </p>
            
            <p>At <u>Eighteenth street</u> I left the car to go to a vestmaker's place at <u>2155 Archer avenue</u>. I was crossing <u>the three points where State and Nineteenth streets intersect</u> when who should come abreast but my benefactor. Instead of raising his hat he jauntily cocked his left eye and came so close to me that the sleeve of my "never-rip" jersey was pressed against the waist-line of his light-gray suit.
            </p>
            
            <p>"<span class="male"><i>Aha, here we are again!</i></span>"
            </p>
            
            <p>Although I distinctly heard every word of his remark I said: "<span class="nellNelson"><i>I beg your pardon</i></span>," with as much of the Newport chill as I could affect.
            </p>
            
            <p>"<span class="male"><i>Come, come, now,</i></span>" he said with increased gayety, moving his waistband still closer to my jersey.
            </p>
            
            <p>"<span class="nellNelson"><i>Oh, you are the gentleman to whom I am indebted for car-fare. You want your money I suppose; if you will give me your card I will write you an order.</i></span>"
            </p>
            
            <p>"<span class="male"><i>Do you work in this neighborhood?</i></span>"
            </p>
            
            <p>"<span class="nellNelson"><i>No sir.</i></span>"
            </p>
            
            <p>"<span class="male"><i>Where, then?</i></span>"
            </p>
            
            <p>"<span class="nellNelson"><i>No place.</i></span>"
            </p>
            
            <p>"<span class="male"><i>Where are you going?</i></span>"
            </p>
            
            <p>"<span class="nellNelson"><i>For work.</i></span>"
            </p>
            
            <p>"<span class="male"><i>What kind?</i></span>"
            </p>
            
            <p>"<span class="nellNelson"><i>Any kind. May I have your card? I am in something of a hurry.</i></span>"
            </p>
            
            <p>"<span class="male"><i>Mayn't I have yours?</i></span>" he asked.
            </p>
            
            <p>"<span class="nellNelson"><i>Certainly; I haven't my case, but if you will lend me a pencil I will write you one.</i></span>"
            </p>
            
            <p>"<span class="male"><i>With pleasure, my dear.</i></span>"
            </p>
            
            <p>"<span class="nellNelson"><i>You are mistaken, sir. That is not my name.</i></span>"
            </p>
            
            <p>"<span class="male"><i>Ha, ha, ha! I see you are a little mischievous, but for all that you are my dear</i></span>," producing three inches of Faber.
            </p>
            
            <p>"<span class="nellNelson"><i>A card please?</i></span>"
            </p>
            
            <p>"<span class="male"><i>Bless me, I had forgotten</i></span>," and the natty-sack-coat was ransacked for a suitable card.
            </p>
            
            <p>"<span class="male"><i>Ah, here-this will do, I hope, in lieu of something more conventional</i></span>," carefully placing on my sewing-box a small card with the address down. I reversed the pasteboard and read on the back:
            </p>
            
            <p>DR. Charles Gilman Smith.</p>
            
            <p>Office Hours _________</p>
            
            <p>Residence___________</p>
            
            <p>"<span class="nellNelson"><i>Dr. Smith! I know him quite well.</i></span>"
            </p>
            
            <p>"<span class="male"><i>Oh, you do, eh?</i></span>" in a tone that left no doubt that his stock in me had dropped. I wrote:
            </p>
            
            <p>Reporter.</p>
            
            <p>The Times.</p>
            
            <p>and handed it to my companion, who read it with eyes that seemed to have been wired open. While he crushed the doctor's card in his left hand his right pulled out a splendid gold watch, and with a most abrupt "<span class="male"><i>Didn't think it was so late, have an engagement at 9:45</i></span>," was off with more alacrity than is conducive to grace. I looked after him, admiring the cut of his coat, the swing of his trousers, the polish of his shoes, and the magnificent carriage of head and shoulders, and thought:
            </p>
            
            <p>"<span class="nellNelson"><i>May the lord deliver us working girls.</i></span>" I also thought that I should like to meet my car friend when I had my suffocating veil off and my good clothes on. Won't Dr. Smith inveigle him to his State street office and present me? I was to give him back his nickel and lead pencil.
            </p>
            
            <p>When I reached the shop at <u>2155 Archer avenue</u> the tailor told me he only wanted one vestmaker and had hired her two hours ago, I then went over on <u>Cottage Grove avenue</u>, borrowed 25 cents from my dressmaker and rode down to <u>Lake street</u> to get work in a feather duster factory. There may have been work, but there was no elevator and I was too hot and tired to go up five flights of stairs to look for it. I chose a cigar factory <u>on Randolph near Dearborn street</u> with but three pairs of stairs to climb and learned in the salesroom that they had all the help they needed. I tried Gomez across the street, who had no work, but enough goodness of heart to give me a chair and a letter to two cigarmakers of his nationality. I went to see <strong>F. Garcia</strong> at <u>20th Clark street</u>. He asked me if I could "strip" and I told him I could. When he wanted to know where
               I had worked I owned up that I didn't know anything at all about the business but was anxious to learn and get work. He didn't know "<span class="male"><i>how a sewing girl would do at the 'fillers' but you might go and talk with some of the help, for you may not be satisfied to try even.</i></span>"
            </p>
            
            <p>He showed me the way across the hall to an empty room. The floor was littered with rags and paper and the dust was heavy on the walls and wood-work and in one corner was a good-sized ash-pile. Garcia rapped for entrance, but there was so much noise within that the door remained fast. When the Spaniard left me I turned the knob and came upon a big boy who was tickling his laborers. The girls were flying around the empty room and their pursuer had both screeching. The fun came to a stop the moment I went in and the young people gladly told me all I cared to know about the business. All they did was to "strip" – just pull the stem or mid-rib from the leaf and put it in a "book-filler." I could get $4 a week and steady work and the next year $5. My informant, a little girl of 15 years, has been in the shop two years and earned $5.30 a week. She told me she was the oldest hand in the shop: that she could "strip" as fast as a man, and put the ribbon bands about the cigars before they were boxed.</p>
            
            <p>At 12:15 o'clock I went into the shop and was given a chair in front of a barrel filled with inches of tobacco called "hands" and lined with gunny-cloth. There was a little tin pail of brown water for wetting I don't know what near my chair, and on the other side a pine board three feet long and sixteen inches wide. When the tobacco leaves were stripped and laid on the board it was thubbed a "book-filler" and carried off
               to the next room. In the shop with this were some eighteen men or more rolling the
               "fillers," putting on the wrappers, shaping the cigars with a broad knife and seeming the ends. Along the tables some of the men were smoking and others chewing, some with their hats on and all in the shirt-sleeves. There were negroes, Swedes, a Chinaman, Germans, and Spaniards, whose influence on the lives of the young girls, while not really harmful, could hardly be called beneficial. I stripped leaves enough to enable me to take the social condition of the inmates, the bad light, impure atmosphere,  the choking smell of the tobacco, and the photographs and prints cut from sensational papers that were tacked on the smoke-stained walls.
            </p>
            
            <p>From the cigar factory I went to the <strong>Excelsior Underwear Company</strong>, <u>199 and 201 Fifth avenue</u> and sat for half an hour while the forewoman scolded a pale-faced girl who wore mourning.
               She had brought back a dozen chemises for which the house paid $2, but the work was
               soiled in the making-machine oil having wet the cotton – and the forewoman refused
               to take it.
            </p>
            
            <p>"<span class="workingGirl"><i>What shall I do?</i></span>" She asked the woman, with a voice as sad as her face.
            </p>
            
            <p>"<span class="female"><i>What does anybody do with dirty things? You will have to pay for laundering the garments
                     of the greasy sewing and clean the thread.</i></span>"
            </p>
            
            <p>Then the girl was left alone by the manager, who went up to the other end of the counter
               to get trimmings for six dozen chemises that a tall young Swede girl was waiting for.The
               forewoman wore a blue dress of plaid design with a Marseilles vest buttoned in it,
               and of seven rings on her left hand six were set with what appeared to be diamonds.
               She had jewels at her chin and in her ears and hair. She measured off the lace edgings
               and the tape insertion and gave minute directions about the fullness and the finish.
               The six dozen garments were bundled up by Mr. Hyman, the proprietor, and the elevator carried her and her load to the pavement below.
               The seamstress told me she lived at home and with the help of her mother made $12
               a week.
            </p>
            
            <p>"<span class="workingGirl"><i>It is very hard work though," she said "We sew day and night. I had rather do it than work down in a shop for I have more
                     self-respect. All the girls are not good, and very few are in a position to go with
                     respectable people. They go with bad company and their language is bad. Sometimes
                     in the winter they dance till daylight and go from the hall to the shop. I don't blame
                     them. The life of a girl who had nothing to depend on but her needle is a best a hard
                     one. Still I don't like to be with a crowd of factory girls if I can help it. The
                     manager and superintendent obliged to be strict, but very seldom make any distinction
                     in the treatment of a nice girl and one who is not so nice. I don't think I can tell
                     you how many ways there are to insult a girl. I have had a foreman just give me a
                     look as I passed in to my machine or handed in my sewing that made me wish I was dead.
                     Then there are the spiteful things the girls say about you and the cutting remarks
                     of the forewoman that make you feel like fainting. The cashier may have a grudge and
                     if he doesn't hold your wages back till all the other hands are paid hell will throw
                     it at you, make you take ragged bills, or give – 'you a week's pay in change.'  A
                     cashier in a <u>Jackson street</u> cravat factory once rubbed his hand across my chin "to feel my whiskers," he said,
                     and because I got angry and said I would report him he saved up all the silver that
                     had holes and plugs and made me take it. My salary was $3.25 that week, and some of
                     the silver couldn't pass. I took it to a bank and the cashier was kind enough to give
                     me good money for it. Plenty of times the forewoman has had me discharged for being
                     "stuck up.</i></span>"
            </p>
            
            <p>Prices here range from 20 cents to $2 a dozen. It depends on the material. Children's
               drawers pay 20 cents a dozen, but there are no button holes to work. Some shirts are
               $2 some $4 and some $1.70 but most of them only pay 20 cents. Everything is done by
               machine including button holes and gussets. The bosoms and bands are ready to go in.
               Corset-covers pay 40 cents and  20 cents each, but they have to be trimmed and the
               holes worked by hand. This is a mean shop, so far as prices go, but they are all alike
               in that particular. You have to find your own thread and you are constantly being
               suspected of keeping back short ends of trimmings.
            </p>
            
            <p>I asked the forewoman for stitching and was given shirts at 80 cents a dozen to do.
               I had to pay 50 cents for the use of the machine and 25 cents for a spindle of thread.
               I told the forewoman I had left my purse at home, but she said it was "<span class="female"><i>alright you can have it taken out of your wages.</i></span>" I asked her what the machine cost, but she doesn't know, and when I ventured that
               the  expiration of the patient had reduced the old place $15 to about $12 she told
               me she "<span class="female"><i>reckoned I didn't know what I was talking about.</i></span>" The room where we worked was about eighteen feet wide and ten feet deep with toilet
               closets built out from the walls. The machines encircled the three walls and in the
               middle of the floor were the boxes of work. One girl was stitching wrist-bands, another
               had button-hole machine and was getting 50 cents a hundred. A third was making tucked
               drawers at 20 cents a dozen and I had a shirt at 60 cents which I failed to finish
               all three hours, being unable to manage a machine.

         <p class="tableText">The following table is a visualization of the nouns used in this article with their
            associated adjectives and possessive pronouns. We tagged all nouns, possesive pronouns,
            and adjectives with the element 'w', with @type specifying if the word was being used
            as a noun or adjective. For nouns, @ana was used if the word was directly linked to
            one of our character archetypes (Nell Nelson, working girl, foreperson, employer,
            employee, benefactor, messenger, or unidentified). For adjectives, @ana was used to
            label the 'stem' of the word (example: lazy, lazier, and laziest all have the same
            @ana='lazy'). For possessive pronouns, @subtype='poss' was added. For this adjective
            form, the @ana represents the character archetype taking posession. The nouns, adjectives,
            and possessive pronouns were linked with the element 'seg'.
         </p>
         <p class="tableText">Our purpose behind this tagging was to exemplify Nell Nelson's distinct vocabulary.
            We asked, when exposing the plight of the working girl, what language do both Nelson
            and the people she conversed with use? For the possesive pronouns, what nouns are
            owned, who is taking ownership of what (or who) is being owned?
