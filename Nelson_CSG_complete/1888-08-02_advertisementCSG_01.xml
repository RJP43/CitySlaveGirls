        <p>This morning prints additional facts concerning female slavery in Chicago. It has begun its crusade against the rascally manufacturers who are driving the poor girls and women to death and worse. In this fight it has taken upon its shoulders the cause of the weak, the poor, and the defenseless, and it means to continue it to the bitter end. Read The Times today and tomorrow and every day. It will tell you the truth regardless of consequences.</p>
