    <head>Annie Schillie Frightfully Injured by Blazing Gasoline on Her Clothes.</head>
    <p>Annie Schillie, a domestic 17 years old employed by Mrs. Kimball at 369 Milwaukee avenue, was burned from head to foot yesterday morning. Mrs. Kimball and Annie were in the kitchen, where a gasoline stove is used. Some of the fluid had leadked out on the stove and floor and Annie, not sure what it was, gathered it up in a pie-pan.</p>
    <p>“What is it?” said Annie.</p>
    <p>“I don't know,” said Mrs. Kimball, “but I will see,” amd she poured a little of the stuff into pan and touched a match to it. It flared up immediately and Annie in her fright threw the panful in her hand on the blaze. That filled the small kitchen with flame. Mrs. Kimball fainted. Annie in trying to smother the flames set fire to her clothes. She ran screaming with pain into the hallway. At the head of the stairway she was met by Mrs. Swain, who hurried her back to the kitchen and threw several pails of water upon her. A Mrs. Beit, living in the front part of the house, had both arms badly burned while extinguishing the fire in the kitchen. A physician said Annie's injuries were fatal. Three fourths of her body was blistered and the shock to her nervous system was so great that her heart almost ceased beating.</p>
    <p>Miss Schillie died at 7 o'clock last evening, after suffering awful agony.</p>
