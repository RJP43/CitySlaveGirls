    <head>Life Among the Slave Girls of Chicago</head>
    <p>NO need to draw upon the imagination nor to indulge in fiction. A dreadful, damnable reality is presented to this community. European methods introduced, developing and expanding here, whereby the marrow is ground out of the bones, the virtue out of the souls, and the souls out of the bodies of the miserable, ill-fed, half-starved, underpaid, insulted, roughly-treated, and unprotected Working Girls.</p>
    <head><p>Shocking Revelations</p><p>Resulting from an investigation put on foot by The Chicago Times</p></head>
    <p>Not a batch of sensational stories in which names are fictitious and addresses are suppressed, but a series of articles which point to the men who are growing rich at the expense of human life and blood. <hi rend="italics">The Real Names and Addresses of Chicago manufacturers</hi> who have established a slave trade; who have transformed honest labor into a bondage; who are practicing the arts of the Pharaohs upon the weak and defenseless women of the city; who are running</p>
    <head>Organized Hells on Earth</head>
    <p>Places where virtue counts for nothing; where girlhood and womanhood are degraded; where moral and physical rottenness abound; where an ulcer is festering that will eat a hole through society. The entire sickening story will be told in this paper <hi rend="italics">without regard to persons or places</hi>.</p>
    <head>The First Installment Will Appear Tomorrow</head>
    <p>And the articles will be published daily until the whole truth is made known to the public.</p>
