    <head>CONCENTRATING WEALTH.</head>
    <p>If all the people of the nation are to be happy and propserous the wealth of the nation must be diffused, not concentrated. The tendency in America is more and more to the concentration and less and less to the diffuction of wealth. The small manufacturer is swallowed up by omnivorous capital. The blacksmith's forge, for example, was once a wayside iron factory, small but useful. The blacksmith now merely affixes ready made shoes with ready made nails. The loom and the spindle are lost to the farm-house. In the industries individuality is repressed and men and women become mere machines. The process tends to the accumulation and not to the diffusion of wealth. Thirty years ago the mammoth fortune was an exception in America. Today millionaires have multiplied but pauperism has increased. A high protective tariff favors this concentration of wealth. Its effect upon factory labor is seen in the disclosures made by THE TIMES.</p>
