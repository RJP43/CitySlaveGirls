    <head>LIFE AMONG THE SLAVE GIRLS OF CHICAGO</head>
    <head>THE TIMES</head>
    <p>Will print tomorrow the second batch of facts concerning the workings of some of the factories in Chicago where girls and women are employed. These articles are written by a young lady who passed through the common experiences of those unfortunates of her own sex who are compelled to undergo the hardships and tortures of factory life in this city. She tells plainly what she saw and what she heard; gives names and places whenever necessary, and backs up her statements with unquestionable proofs.</p>
    <p>These are revelations as unexpected as they are unpleasant. It was necessary that The Times should make them in order that the unthinking wealthy, well-to-do, and comfortable citizens of Chicago should have their eyes opened.</p>
    <p>If the condition of the working women and girls of this city is improved, even in a slight degree, by these exposures. The Times will be fully repaid.</p>
    <p>Read The Times every day this week. Two cents per copy. Delivered by carrier, 12 cents per week for Daily and 15 cents per week for Daily and Sunday. Order it by postal card, letter, or telephone 1362.</p>
