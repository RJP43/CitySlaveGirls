    <p>INTEREST in the conditions of the Chicago factory girls is aroused. Nothing proves this more conclusively than the present extraordinary demand for THE TIMES.</p>
    <p>Yesterday’s revelations were of a character decidedly surprising to the good people who believe everybody in Chicago should be contented and happy. Today’s revelations will add to their amazement. Tomorrow they will probably be stunned.</p>
    <p>The inquiry is in good hands. It will not be abridged. THE TIMES will push it to the end.</p>
    <p>Extra editions of THE TIMES of Monday and Tuesday have been run off to meet the demand for the articles already published. These papers can be had at the business office at 2 cents per copy.</p>
