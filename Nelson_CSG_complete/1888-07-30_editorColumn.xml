        <p>THE TIMES lays before its readers this morning the opening chapter of a story that will surprise a very large number of people in Chicago who do not believe that there is anything wrong going on in this city.</p>
        <p>They have read of such things in novels, but the scenes were laid elsewhere. The novelist who painted from subjects in low life could certainly find no material in this great, wealthy, progressive city, where all is happiness, all contentment. The little black shawl of the Chicago factory girl has covered untold miseries for several years past, and it would continue to cover them up for years to come perhaps had not THE TIMES undertake this inquiry.</p>
        <p>When THE TIMES gets through the public must act. Slavery should not exist in Chicago in any form whatsoever. Christian doctrines and Christian laws forbid it.</p>
        <p>Follow the young lady who tells of her own personal experience elsewhere in today's TIMES. Follow her to the end of her story. It will do you good to know the worst.</p>
