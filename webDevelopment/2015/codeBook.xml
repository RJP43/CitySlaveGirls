  *****Here's how to code text that is unreadable or difficult to transcribe***** 
    
Use the "damage" element for when some aspect of the text is difficult to read. 
Follow with the "unclear" and "supplied" in combination and make a reasonable guess for what's missing. 
Your reading should sit within the <unclear><supplied>..</supplied></unclear> tagset. 
If you cannot read the text at all still provide the damage tag and follow it with a self-closing <unclear/> element leaving out the "supplied" element. 

For Example:

<damage agent="smudge" unit="word" quantity="9"/><unclear><supplied resp="#rjp">your best guess here to what the text says</supplied></unclear>

Explanation of Attributes
<damage>
   @unit values
     unit="word" 
     unit="chars" <!-- for missing "characters" inside of a word -->
     unit="sentence"
   @quantity values
     in relation to the unit -- how many units are unclear
   @agent values
     agent="smudge"
     agent="blurred" <!-- if unclear due to poor photographic image qulaity  -->
     agent="fold"
     agent="torn"
</damage>
<supplied>
    @resp <!-- this is a declaration of who is responsible for the interpretation of text-->
     resp="#yourInitials" <!-- the hash tag is reference to the xml:id that each editor will have in the site index! For now each editor's id should be the editor's and that gets supplied after the # hashtag which will later link it to the site index.-->
</supplied>

  *****Hereâ€™s how to code idiosyncratic and standard spellings.*****        

<p>Less than ten minutes was spent over the wretched meal. At one side of the west wall, separated by a ten-foot pine partition, was the toilet-room containing an iron <choice><sic>zinc</sic><reg resp="#rjp">sink</reg></choice> with one faucet of running water.</p>
  
  <choice>Holds the entire context including the word originally used and our correction to the more modern or known spelling</choice>
  <sic>Contains the word as it appeared in the original</sic>
  <reg>Contains our correction to the more modern or known spelling of the word
    @resp <!-- this is a declaration of who is responsible for supplying the corrected word-->
    resp="#yourInitials" <!-- the hash tag is reference to the xml:id that each editor will have in the site index! For now each editor's id should be the editor's and that gets supplied after the # hashtag which will later link it to the site index.-->

    <seg>short for segment -- any chunk of text</seg>
    inside 
    <seg>
    <w>word</w> multiple words in a single seg too bound them together
      @type = part of speech ie. "noun" | "adjective" 
      @subtype = specification "poss" (meaning possesive) 
      @ana = stem of word so to link other forms of the same word (stemming) for adjectives
                AND 
                canonical references for proper nouns ie. "workingGirl" | "foreperson" | "nellNelson" | "employer" | "employee" | "benefactor" | "messenger"

The <seg><w type="adj" ana="lazy">lazy</w> <w type="noun" ana="foreperson">foreman</w></seg> yelled at her, "You are the <seg><w type="adj" ana="lazy">laziest</w> <w type="noun" ana="workingGirl">stitcher</w></seg>".
