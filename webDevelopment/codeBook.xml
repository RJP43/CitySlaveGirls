Use the "damage" element for when some aspect of the text is difficult to read. 
Follow with the "unclear" and "supplied" in combination and make a reasonable guess for what's missing. 
Your reading should sit within the <unclear><supplied>..</supplied></unclear> tagset. 
If you cannot read the text at all still provide the damage tag and follow it with a self-closing <unclear/> element leaving out the <supplied> element. 

For Example:

<damage agent="smudge" unit="word" quantity="9"/><unclear><supplied resp="#rjp">your best guess here to what the text says</supplied></unclear>

Hereâ€™s how to code idiosyncratic and standard spellings.        

     <p>Text text text text text text text text text <choice><sic>Wierd</sic><reg resp="#rjp">weird</reg></choice> text text text

<choice><sic>every body</sic><reg resp="#rjp">everybody</reg></choice>
