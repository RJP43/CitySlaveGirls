This is a public work space for experimenting with the coding and digitization of the "City Slave Girls" series printed in the _Chicago Times_, 1888.  

The original publication in the _Chicago Times_ and was authored by Helen Cusack under the pseudonym Nell Nelson.  
After the original newspaper publication there were two books published within the same year that included edited, abridged versions of the series. (There is also evidence that the series was republished in New York's _World_ newspaper the following year.)
