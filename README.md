This is a public work space to experiment with coding and digitizing the "City Slave Girls" series of the _Chicago Times_, 1888.  

The original publication in the _Chicago Times_ and was authored by Helen Cusack under the pseudonym Nell Nelson.  
After the original newspaper publication there were two books published within the same year that included edited, abridged versions of the series. (There is also evidence that the series was republished in New York's _World_ newspaper the following year.)

#### There are four main facets of this project:

    1. Transcription of all three sources 
    
    2. Conversion of these three texts into TEI XML (our codebook is available [here](https://github.com/RJP43/CitySlaveGirls/wiki/Checkout-our-Codebook!))
    
    3. Biographical Research on the series' author Nell Nelson and Research into other publications of the series
    
    4. Data Analysis
  

#### Future Project Goals:

    * construction of a Chicago Map dating back to the late nineteenth century plotting points mentioned in the series
    * retaining new, clearer photographs of the original articles that can be available alongside transcriptions
