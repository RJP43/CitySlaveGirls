This is a public work space to experiment with coding and digitizing the "City Slave Girls" series of 1888.
The original publication was in the Chicago Daily Times and was authored by a woman under the pseudonym Nell Nelson.  
After the original newspaper publication there were two books published in the same year that included edited, abridged versions of the series. (There is also evidence that the series was republished in New York's <em>World</em> newspaper the following year.)

#### There are four main facets of this project:

    1. Transcription of all three sources 
    
    2. Conversion of these three texts into TEI XML
    
    3. Biographical Research on the series' author Nell Nelson and Research into other publications of the series
    
    4. Data Analysis
  

#### In Progress:

    * continued transcription from photo images of the original articles 
    * the development of OCR able to convert photo images of the original articles into plain text
    * construction of a Chicago Map dating back to the late nineteenth century plotting points mentioned in the series
    * retaining new clearer photographs of the original articles 
    * marking up the remaining files according to TEI XML
    * Data Analysis
