                            >went to Ellinger's cloak factory, 282 Madison street</span> , where
                        labor is bondage, the laboror a slave, and flesh and blood cheaper than
                        needles and thread. Corporations are said to be without heart, but this
                        concern is a commercial inquisition. It puts its help on the plane of
                        slavery, and nothing but civil law prevents the use of the lash. </p>
                    <p> The factory is on the third floor of the large brick building <span
                            class="othersChange"> at the east end of Madison street bridge on the
                            south side of the street.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p> Elevator? Not much. </p>
                    <p> An elevator is a luxury, and luxuries have no place <span
                            class="othersChange">at Ellinger's</span> . You will be short of breath
                        when you reach the top of the fourth flight, but in recovering you have time
                        to take in the surroundings - a great barn of a place with a single charm of
                        good light. There is plenty of vacant room, but the women are huddled
                        together, elbows touching along the line of machines. Beneath the west
                        windows flows the river; at the south end of the room, not ten feet from the
                        crowded table, is a tier of closets, and on hot days the combined odor of
                        the two is shocking. Nobody in his employ dare complain about smells, cold,
                        heat, work, wages or rules. But <span class="othersChange">whoever</span>
                        heard of martyrs complaining? </p>

                    <p> My experience began at 7:50 <span class="othersChange">a.m.</span> and
                        lasted just three hours. When I climbed the dusty stairs I took a ten-minute
                        rest at the top. Everybody was at work but a hungry-looking man about 27
                        years old, with skin the color of a Russia turnip and thin, peaked features.
                        He was dressed in a pair of heel-less slippers, a white shirt, and a pair of
                        shop pants that a clothing store pays 18 cents for making. Neither collar,
                        vest, coat nor suspenders burdened his emaciated form. He moved among the
                        workers with a cat-like tread, his shoulders drooping and his knees opening
                        and shutting with a sort of accordion movement at every step. He passed me
                        several times as I stood at the desk and eyed me so unpleasantly that I
                        turned my back to him. </p>
                    <p> After waiting at the desk for three-quarters of an hour, I asked the clerk,
                        a sweet little girl of 16 years, with pretty red cheeks and dark eyelashes
                        and hair, for work, and was told to wait till the forelady came round. A
                        dozen girls were waiting, too, some with cloaks, others with check-books and
                        tickets, and a few with hand-made fringe. The fringe-girl I spoke to. She
                        told me she received 5 cents a yard for making an imitation of seal-ball
                        fringe, such as winter cloaks are trimmed with. She had a piece three yards
                        and a quarter long that had taken her all the previous day to make. Here was
                        a child of 15 working nine and a half hours a day for a competence of 16 1/4
                        cents. Will the Prairie avenue woman, who, at the suggestion of Mrs. Ormison
                        Chant, is trying to find one hundred girls who are earning less than 28
                        cents a day please enter Maggie W--- on the list, and will the women of the
                        Protective agency who want a new field of inquiry, call and see this slim,
                        snake-gaited, jaundice-faced creature who has charge of this human mill. </p>
                    <p> Maggie's fringe being measured and her book checked, she was given another
                        box of material and went off to weave it into tassel-trimming. The girl who
                        took her place would not be interviewed. She didn't know how much stitchers
                        earned and wouldn't tell how much a week she could make." She was, possibly,
                        25 years old, with a deathly pale face, and looked as if she hadn't eaten
                        any breakfast. Her successor was less reticent. "I'm here since May, but I
                        don't like it; the boss is a horrid thing. Him and the forelady watches us
                        all the time, and they don't give us hardly any work. I can only make one
                        cloak a day; some pays 30 cents, some 40 cents, and some 50 cents. Yesterday
                        I had only 60 cents coming to me for two days. Are you long here? Oh, you
                        won't stay. They search your bag and your pocket when you go home nights to
                        see if you have any thread or pieces about you." </p>
                    <p> </p>
                    <p> Before I had a chance to talk with another unfortunate the little
                        rosy-cheeked clerk told me "it's against the rules for new hands to stand
                        here. You must go over by the stairs and wait till the forelady comes." I
                        smiled at the pretty child and she rewarded me by bringing a chair to me a
                        few minutes later. All means of <span class="othersChange"
                            >communication</span> being cut off I amused myself making sketches of
                        the shirted, slippered, sleuth-like creature as he passed. </p>
                    <p> This pastime was interrupted by the appearance of a fat woman. She had on a
                        black sateen suit that fitted her puffy figure like the raiment of a
                        well-boiled suet pudding. She carried herself like a drum major on a dress
                        parade and by way of ornaments wore a gold watch with a double coil of gold
                        chain at her belt, gold earrings, a gold breast pin, gold cuff-buttons and
                        two gold rings. Bigger than bust or bustle was the woman's head I discovered
                        when I asked: </p>
                    <p> "Are you the forewoman?" </p>
                    <p> "Forelady, yes. What do you want?" </p>
                    <p> "Work." </p>
                    <p> "What can you do?" </p>
                    <p> "Sew." </p>
                    <p> "Where have you been working?" </p>
                    <p> " <span class="othersChange">Never-Rip company.</span> " </p>

                    <p> "Want to stitch?" </p>
                    <p> "No, I would rather finish." </p>
                    <p> "Give your name to the clerk." </p>
                    <p> I complied and was entered on his book as the resident of a vacant lot on
                        Monroe street. The forewoman selected a bundle as big as a Kamschatka baby
                        from a mountain of bundles and said: </p>
                    <p> "Here, go over there and wait till I come." </p>
                    <p> "How much do you pay for this class of work?" </p>
                    <p> "I don't know. It seems to me you're mighty particular." </p>
                    <p> "If you don't know who does?" I asked. </p>
                    <p> "You make me dizzy," she said, dropping the bundle and giving me a look of
                        intense disgust. She took a small book from her pocket containing the
                        price-list and asked me what number. </p>
                    <p> "I don't know." </p>
                    <p> "Look." </p>
                    <p> "Where?" </p>
                    <p> "You'll come down a peg or two before long," and with a groan she bent over
                        the bundle at her feet, flushed apoplectically and said "360." Referring
                        again to her price-list: "Them's sixty-five cents," and left me. </p>
                    <p> I raised that 65-cent ulster, and with my arms folded about the fuzzy,
                        ill-smelling thing, moved "down there," as directed, and halted at the edge
                        of a huge rag-box. Here I stood for twenty minutes, when the forewoman came
                        aft and bade me "this way." I pursued. There was a halt about the middle of
                        the shop and I seized it for a "scoop." </p>
                    <p> "How many girls have you here?" </p>
                    <p> "Never counted them." </p>
                    <p> "What can experienced cloak hands earn in a day?" </p>
                    <p> "Never asked them." </p>
                    <p> "How much of your salary is for politeness?" </p>
                    <p> "You can sit here," pointing to a cane chair with half the seat gone. "That
                        girl with the black dress will do your stitching; the one at the end of the
                        second table will bind the seams, and Annie down there in brown calico -
                        she's fixing the machine now - will give you any help," and she was off. </p>
                    <p> "I beg your pardon, did I understand you to say I would get sixty-five cents
                        for making this cloak?" following her. </p>
                    <p> "Now you're just a little bit too fresh. If you don't want the work, say
                        so." </p>
                    <p> "I do want the work, but I want to know what it will pay first." </p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="othersChange">"This is a 65-cent cloak. Do you get that through

                                <span class="othersChange">30</span> cents for finishing if the work
                            is right. If it isn't, you get out."</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="othersChange"> I thanked her and was alone. Here I thought lay
                            my fortune. Thirty cents for making a long cloth cloak, after the seams
                            were stitched. It had to be trimed down the back gores around the
                            collar, cuffs, and pockets with mohair plush; the sleeves had to go in,
                            eighteen buttons sewed on, eighteen holes worked, and all the seams and
                            edges faced with black muslin. Thirty cents! To save my life I couldn't
                            have finished the garment in ten hours. I was just reaching that
                            conclusion when the forewoman appeared with a small book, two checks,
                            and a piece of tailor's chalk as big as a dime. </span>
                    </p>
                    <p> "Your number is 180; chalk it on all these pieces and if you lose any you
                        will be fined." </p>
                    <p> "How much?" </p>
                    <p> "How much? You cheeky thing! The cost of the cloth and the cutter's time.
                        That's how much. Give this check to the binder and that one to the
                        stitcher." </p>
                    <p> "Will you please tell me how this side gore goes?" </p>
                    <p> "Go to Annie. I ain't here to learn you how to sew." </p>
                    <p> "May I have a needle?" </p>
                    <p> "Furnish your own needles." </p>

                    <p> "May I have basting cotton?" </p>
                    <p> "There aint any. You have to wait till it gets here." </p>
                    <p> I gave a girl a penny for a needle and stole some thread from an absentee's
                        stock. Then I waited fifteen minutes while the binder got through and basted
                        up the seams for the stitcher. That much done I got to work on the plush.
                        The forewoman passed by and told me I <span class="othersChange">was not
                            "showing enough fur. Go over to the sample and look at the work."</span>
                    </p>
                    <p> She sneered when I asked her where the samples were, but a neighbor
                        volunteered the information. There was no sample on the rack and I stepped
                        over to inform the forewoman, who curtly told me it was none of her affair. </p>
                    <p> "Will you please tell me how wide to make this trimming?" </p>
                    <p> "Go to Annie." </p>
                    <p> Poor Annie was doctoring a machine and said "in a minute." On her way to me
                        three stitchers implored her to look at their miserable implements and I
                        waited patiently till I caught sight of the forewoman looking at her bangs
                        in a handglass. Apologizing for the intrusion I asked her if the sample had
                        come yet. </p>
                    <p> "No." </p>
                    <p> "I wish you would kindly show me how wide to make this trimming." </p>
                    <p> "Go to Annie, I told you." </p>
                    <p> "Annie is too busy. She's mending machines." </p>
                    <p> "Well, I won't be bothered with you." </p>
                    <p> "What's the reason you won't?" </p>
                    <p> "Cause I won't" </p>
                    <p> "Well you will. Tell me how wide you want this plush or I will <span
                            class="othersChange">see Mr. Ellinger.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p> "See him. I don't care. There he is," pointing to the snaky, half-starved
                        creature whose shanks I had been sketching and on whom I had scornfully
                        turned my back. It was too much to ask of a free-born American woman to
                        recognize the <span class="othersChange">su-periority</span> of such a
                        person. He came up to us in an instant. The forewoman was livid with rage
                        and she began to talk as fast as her tongue could move. Some fifty or more
                        girls heard the tirade breathlessly. Before the half-dressed proprietor had
                        a chance to get over his astonishment I threw the front of the cloak at his
                        face, the side body at the forewoman, and walked off to my disabled chair
                        with <span class="othersChange">Mr. Ellinger</span> for a bodyguard. He was
                        the color of a sanitarium babe when we reached my work table. He had the two
                        pieces of cloak in his hand, and when he raised his fist to strike me I
                        worked up an Indian-club attitude and dared him. </p>
                    <p> He escorted me to the toilet-room, where I went for my hat and jacket, and
                        before slamming the door in his face by way of a hint as to the privacy of
                        the place I threw my needle and thread at him. <span class="othersChange">A.
                            Ellinger</span> saw me across the shop and down the first flight of
                        stairs. And there ended my first experience in a cloak factory. </p>

                    </ul>
                    <p> I next made application for work at <span class="othersChange"
                            >Wetherell's</span> , on Wabash avenue, where hundreds of girls are
                        employed on corsets, bustles, skirts, jerseys and cloaks. Boarding the
                        freight elevator I was drawn up to the top floor, where a pretty little
                        Jewess informed me that <span class="othersChange">Mr. Saalsbery</span> was
                        engaged, but would see me in a little while. She showed me to a seat in the
                        rear end of the store at the entrance to the shop-room, and for a single
                        hour I listened to the drop, drop, drop of the heavy machinery and the
                        snatches of song and merriment between the iron roar. Presently <span
                            class="othersChange">Mr. Wetherell</span> came and sat by me. </p>
                    <p> "Did you want work?" he asked. </p>
                    <p> "Very much. </p>
                    <p> "What kind of work have you been doing?" </p>
                    <p> I admitted I had never worked in a factory, but told him I could sew and was
                        willing to do anything that would give me a living. </p>
                    <p> "Well, you ought to have a chance - a good chance if you are willing to work
                        - but it's dull just now and I don't see where we can put you. You say you
                        can sew. Run the machine, too? Well, we start our skirt and cloak rooms in a
                        couple of weeks and then we can try you." </p>
                    <p> "But I must have work," I persisted, "at once. <span class="othersOmit">I
                            can't wait two weeks."</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="othersChange">Mr. Wetherell</span> sighed a little and left me
                        to see a customer who had just then entered. While I was fixing up a romance
                        in case any inquiry was made as to my age, name, residence and position in
                        life a sad-faced Irish mother came up the four stories with a 16-year-old
                        daughter. They were as poorly dressed as myself, but considerably less
                        happy. The mother's hands were hard, thin and work-worn, and her face seamed
                        with care. She wore an old bonnet, a coarse black dress, poor shoes, an old
                        shawl, and an expression of injury, despondency and severity. Annie was a
                        well-developed girl, with a good, wholesome face, red cheeks, bright,
                        fun-loving eyes, big hands and feet, a most ungainly manner, and a nice
                        figure. She had been crying, for her lashes were wet, and she seemed
                        expectant that a crisis of some sort was near at hand. I soon learned that
                        the mother missed her calling when she adopted maternal duties. The family
                        lived in the region of Blue Island avenue and consisted of the parents and
                        growing children, two or three having married. Annie was the youngest and
                        "had to do something for her grub, " as the mother said. For a long, time
                        she worked in a box factory and made good wages, but the work was not
                        steady, and last January she came to <span class="othersChange"
                            >Wetherell's</span> . </p>
                    <p> And what do you think she did? </p>
                    <p> She earned 80 cents a week cutting dress reeds from 7:30 o'clock in the
                        morning until 5:30 in the evening. Annie will be 17 years old in September.
                        Here is her account of the work: </p>
                    <p> "Oh yes, I like it. They don't pay me much, but the <span
                            class="othersChange">forelady's</span> good to me, and <span
                            class="othersChange">Mr. Saalsbery</span> is awful kind. The girls is
                        nice, too. The only thing I don't like is that they're always cuttin' me
                        down. I can't make hardly nothing." </p>
                    <p> "Last week? Oh, last week I wasn't here. I staid home. It was so hot I
                        didn't want to take the trouble to come down for 13 cents a day and walk and
                        put up my lunch." </p>
                    <p> Thinking the girl's calculations were amiss I turned to the mother, who
                        confirmed the statement, adding: "It don't pay to feed that kid to work on
                        the pay she's getting." </p>
                    <p> "It's what all the girl's gets," added Annie, beginning to cry. I played
                        mother for a little while, told her she was a good girl to help her parents
                        and not to mind, for there was plenty of work, and if she comes to <span
                            class="othersChange">THE TIMES</span> I'll help her get it. </p>
                    <p> After the Irish gray eyes had been dried with both corners of her little
                        black shawl she gave me the prices at which she had been working. Here they
                        are: </p>
                    <p> One cent a gross for cutting steels in eleven, fifteen and eighteen inch
                        length. The work is done by machine, the operator using one foot and both
                        hands constantly. </p>
                    <p> Four cents a gross for sewing buckles on bustles. </p>
                    <p> Three cents a dozen for basting bustles. </p>
                    <p> Four cents a dozen for springing bustles. </p>
                    <p> Seventy cents a dozen for putting elastics on reeds and boxing the same. </p>
                    <p> Wages in this department vary from 60 cents to $3 a week, $1.50 being a very
                        fair average, and this, too, for girls of 19 years and less. </p>
                    <p> When the manager had dismissed his guest he waited on Annie's mother, who
                        turned traitress, betraying her own child to the enemy in this style: </p>
                    <p> "Can Annie come back, sir?" she asked. </p>
                    <p> "Why, I guess so. What's been the matter?" </p>
                    <p> Annie rolled her finger up in black fringe, hung her head, and allowed the
                        tears to stream down her cheeks. </p>
                    <p> "Oh she's so sassy," kindly volunteered the mother, "and she comes home to
                        me with a batch of stories every night about your cuttin' down the prices.
                        Sure I can't believe a word she says." </p>
                    <p> "Well, you come in the morning, Annie, and I'll see what we can do for you."
                        With this dismissal, poor Annie followed her mother, who doubtless felt that
                        she had done her duty by the child. </p>
                    <p> I recited my piece to the low-voiced gentleman, who said there was plenty of
                        work in the bustle department, but he guessed it wouldn't be pleasant for
                        me, as the girls were only sixteen or so. I tried to assure him that I
                        didn't care about the company, that I only wanted a chance to make a living
                        for myself. </p>
                    <p> "Well, I don't think you could earn enough to support yourself at machine
                        work. Come in about Monday and I <span class="othersChange">think</span> we
                        can give you something at $3 or so." </p>
                    <p> "Three dollars a week?" </p>
                    <p> "Yes." </p>
                    <p> "God have mercy on the girls," I said reverently and departed. </p>

                    </ul>
                    <p> I did not realize the ignominious position of respectable <span
                            class="change">pov-erty</span> till I <span class="change">went to E's
                            cloak factory</span>, where labor is bondage, the laboror a slave, and
                        flesh and blood cheaper than needles and thread. Corporations are said to be
                        without heart, but this concern is a commercial inquisition. It puts its
                        help on the plane of slavery, and nothing but civil law prevents the use of
                        the lash.</p>
                    <p> The factory is on the third floor of the large brick building at the east
                        end of <span class="change">Madison</span> street bridge on the south side
                        of the street. </p>
                    <p> Elevator? Not much. </p>
                    <p> An elevator is a luxury, and luxuries have no place <span class="change">at
                            E's</span> . You will be short of breath when you reach the top of the
                        fourth flight, but in recovering you have time to take in the surroundings -
                        a great barn of a place with a single charm of good light. There is plenty
                        of vacant room, but the women are huddled together, elbows touching along
                        the line of machines. Beneath the west windows flows the river; at the south
                        end of the room, not ten feet from the crowded table, is a tier of closets,
                        and on hot days the combined odor of the two is shocking. Nobody in his
                        employ dare complain about smells, cold, heat, work, wages or rules. But
                        whoever heard of martyrs complaining? </p>
                    <p> My experience began at 7:50 <span class="change">A. M.</span> and lasted
                        just three hours. When I climbed the dusty stairs I took a ten-minute rest
                        at the top. Everybody was at work but a hungry-looking man about 27 years
                        old, with skin the color of a Russia turnip and thin, peaked features. He
                        was dressed in a pair of heel-less slippers, a white shirt, and a pair of
                        shop pants that a clothing store pays 18 cents for making. Neither collar,
                        vest, coat nor suspenders burdened his emaciated form. He moved among the
                        workers with a cat-like tread, his shoulders drooping and his knees opening
                        and shutting with a sort of accordion movement at every step. He passed me
                        several times as I stood at the desk and eyed me so unpleasantly that I
                        turned my back to him. </p>
                    <p> After waiting at the desk for three-quarters of an hour, I asked the clerk,
                        a sweet little girl of 16 years, with pretty red cheeks and dark eyelashes
                        and hair, for work, and was told to wait till the forelady came round. A
                        dozen girls were waiting, too, some with cloaks, others with check-books and
                        tickets, and a few with hand-made fringe. The fringe-girl I spoke to. She
                        told me she received 5 cents a yard for making an imitation of seal-ball
                        fringe, such as winter cloaks are trimmed with. She had a piece three yards
                        and a quarter long that had taken her all the previous day to make. Here was
                        a child of 15 working nine and a half hours a day for a competence of 16 1/4
                        cents. Will the Prairie avenue woman, who, at the suggestion of Mrs. Ormison
                        Chant, is trying to find one hundred girls who are earning less than 28
                        cents a day please enter Maggie W--- on the list, and will the women of the
                        Protective agency who want a new field of inquiry, call and see this slim,
                        snake-gaited, jaundice-faced creature who has charge of this human mill. </p>
                    <p> Maggie's fringe being measured and her book checked, she was given another
                        box of material and went off to weave it into tassel-trimming. The girl who
                        took her place would not be interviewed. She didn't know how much stitchers
                        earned and wouldn't tell how much a week she could make." She was, possibly,
                        25 years old, with a deathly pale face, and looked as if she hadn't eaten
                        any breakfast. Her successor was less reticent. "I'm here since May, but I
                        don't like it; the boss is a horrid thing. Him and the forelady watches us
                        all the time, and they don't give us hardly any work. I can only make one
                        cloak a day; some pays 30 cents, some 40 cents, and some 50 cents. Yesterday
                        I had only 60 cents coming to me for two days. Are you long here? Oh, you
                        won't stay. They search your bag and your pocket when you go home nights to
                        see if you have any thread or pieces about you." </p>
                    <p> Before I had a chance to talk with another unfortunate the little
                        rosy-cheeked clerk told me "it's against the rules for new hands to stand
                        here. You must go over by the stairs and wait till the forelady comes." I
                        smiled at the pretty child and she rewarded me by bringing a chair to me a
                        few minutes later. All means of <span class="change">cummunication</span>
                        being cut off I amused myself making sketches of the shirted, slippered,
                        sleuth-like creature as he passed. </p>
                    <p> This pastime was interrupted by the appearance of a fat woman. She had on a
                        black sateen suit that fitted her puffy figure like the raiment of a
                        well-boiled suet pudding. She carried herself like a drum major on a dress
                        parade and by way of ornaments wore a gold watch with a double coil of gold
                        chain at her belt, gold earrings, a gold breast pin, gold cuff-buttons and
                        two gold rings. Bigger than bust or bustle was the woman's head I discovered
                        when I asked: </p>
                    <p> "Are you the forewoman?" </p>
                    <p> "Forelady, yes. What do you want?" </p>
                    <p> "Work." </p>
                    <p> "What can you do?" </p>
                    <p> "Sew." </p>
                    <p> "Where have you been working?" </p>
                    <p> " <span class="change">N. R. Co.</span> " </p>
                    <p> "Want to stitch?" </p>
                    <p> "No, I would rather finish." </p>
                    <p> "Give your name to the clerk." </p>
                    <p> I complied and was entered on his book as the resident of a vacant lot on
                        Monroe street. The forewoman selected a bundle as big as a Kamschatka baby
                        from a mountain of bundles and said: </p>
                    <p> "Here, go over there and wait till I come." </p>
                    <p> "How much do you pay for this class of work?" </p>
                    <p> "I don't know. It seems to me you're mighty particular." </p>
                    <p> "If you don't know who does?" I asked. </p>
                    <p> "You make me dizzy," she said, dropping the bundle and giving me a look of
                        intense disgust. She took a small book from her pocket containing the
                        price-list and asked me what number. </p>
                    <p> "I don't know." </p>
                    <p> "Look." </p>
                    <p> "Where?" </p>
                    <p> "You'll come down a peg or two before long," and with a groan she bent over
                        the bundle at her feet, flushed apoplectically and said "360." Referring
                        again to her price-list: "Them's sixty-five cents," and left me. </p>
                    <p> I raised that 65-cent ulster, and with my arms folded about the fuzzy,
                        ill-smelling thing, moved "down there," as directed, and halted at the edge
                        of a huge rag-box. Here I stood for twenty minutes, when the forewoman came
                        aft and bade me "this way." I pursued. There was a halt about the middle of
                        the shop and I seized it for a "scoop." </p>
                    <p> "How many girls have you here?" </p>
                    <p> "Never counted them." </p>
                    <p> "What can experienced cloak hands earn in a day?" </p>
                    <p> "Never asked them." </p>
                    <p> "How much of your salary is for politeness?" </p>
                    <p> "You can sit here," pointing to a cane chair with half the seat gone. "That
                        girl with the black dress will do your stitching; the one at the end of the
                        second table will bind the seams, and Annie down there in brown calico -
                        she's fixing the machine now - will give you any help," and she was off. </p>
                    <p> "I beg your pardon, did I understand you to say I would get sixty-five cents
                        for making this cloak?" following her. </p>
                    <p> "Now your're just a little bit too fresh. If you don't want the work, say
                        so." </p>
                    <p> "I do want the work, but I want to know what it will pay first." </p>
                    <p> "This is a 65-cent cloak. Do you get that through your head? The stitcher
                        gets <span class="change">twenty</span> cents, the binder gets <span
                            class="change">fifteen</span> cents, and you get <span class="change"
                            >thirty</span> cents for finishing if the work is right. If it isn't,
                        you get out." </p>
                    <p> I thanked her and was alone. Here I thought lay my fortune. Thirty cents for
                        making a long cloth cloak, after the seams were stitched. It had to be
                        trimed down the back gores around the collar, cuffs, and pockets with mohair
                        plush; the sleeves had to go in, eighteen buttons sewed on, eighteen holes
                        worked, and all the seams and edges faced with black muslin. Thirty cents!
                        To save my life I couldn't have finished the garment in ten hours. I was
                        just reaching that conclusion when the forewoman appeared with a small book,
                        two checks, and a piece of tailor's chalk as big as a dime. </p>
                    <p> "Your number is 180; chalk it on all these pieces and if you lose any you
                        will be fined." </p>
                    <p> "How much?" </p>
                    <p> "How much? You cheeky thing! The cost of the cloth and the cutter's time.
                        That's how much. Give this check to the binder and that one to the
                        stitcher." </p>
                    <p> "Will you please tell me how this side gore goes?" </p>
                    <p> "Go to Annie. I ain't here to learn you how to sew." </p>
                    <p> "May I have a needle?" </p>
                    <p> "Furnish your own needles." </p>
                    <p> "May I have basting cotton?" </p>
                    <p> "There aint any. You have to wait till it gets here." </p>
                    <p> I gave a girl a penny for a needle and stole some thread from an absentee's
                        stock. Then I waited fifteen minutes while the binder got through and basted
                        up the seams for the stitcher. That much done I got to work on the plush.
                        The forewoman passed by and told me I <span class="change">"was not showing
                            enough fur. Go over to the sample and look at the work."</span>
                    </p>
                    <p> She sneered when I asked her where the samples were, but a neighbor
                        volunteered the information. There was no sample on the rack and I stepped
                        over to inform the forewoman, who curtly told me it was none of her affair. </p>
                    <p> "Will you please tell me how wide to make this trimming?" </p>
                    <p> "Go to Annie." </p>
                    <p> Poor Annie was doctoring a machine and said "in a minute." On her way to me
                        three stitchers implored her to look at their miserable implements and I
                        waited patiently till I caught sight of the forewoman looking at her bangs
                        in a handglass. Apologizing for the intrusion I asked her if the sample had
                        come yet. </p>
                    <p> "No." </p>
                    <p> "I wish you would kindly show me how wide to make this trimming." </p>
                    <p> "Go to Annie, I told you." </p>
                    <p> "Annie is too busy. She's mending machines." </p>
                    <p> "Well, I won't be bothered with you." </p>
                    <p> "What's the reason you won't?" </p>
                    <p> "Cause I won't" </p>
                    <p> "Well you will. Tell me how wide you want this plush or I will <span
                            class="change">see Mr A---"</span>
                    </p>
                    <p> "See him. I don't care. There he is," pointing to the snaky, half-starved
                        creature whose shanks I had been sketching and on whom I had scornfully
                        turned my back. It was too much to ask of a free-born American woman to
                        recognize the <span class="change">superi-ority</span> of such a person. He
                        came up to us in an instant. The forewoman was livid with rage and she began
                        to talk as fast as her tongue could move. Some fifty or more girls heard the
                        tirade breathlessly. Before the half-dressed proprietor had a chance to get
                        over his astonishment I threw the front of the cloak at his face, the side
                        body at the forewoman, and walked off to my disabled chair with <span
                            class="change">Mr. A.</span> for a bodyguard. He was the color of a
                        sanitarium babe when we reached my work table. He had the two pieces of
                        cloak in his hand, and when he raised his fist to strike me I worked up an
                        Indian-club attitude and dared him. </p>
                    <p> He escorted me to the toilet-room, where I went for my hat and jacket, and
                        before slamming the door in his face by way of a hint as to the privacy of
                        the place I threw my needle and thread at him. <span class="change">Mr.
                            A.</span> saw me across the shop and down the first flight of stairs.
                        And there ended my first experience in a cloak factory. </p>

                    <p> I next made application for work at <span class="change">W's</span> , on
                        Wabash avenue, where hundreds of girls are employed on corsets, bustles,
                        skirts, jerseys and cloaks. Boarding the freight elevator I was drawn up to
                        the top floor, where a pretty little Jewess informed me that <span
                            class="change">Mr. S.</span> was engaged, but would see me in a little
                        while. She showed me to a seat in the rear end of the store at the entrance
                        to the shop-room, and for a single hour I listened to the drop, drop, drop
                        of the heavy machinery and the snatches of song and merriment between the
                        iron roar. Presently <span class="change">Mr. W.</span> came and sat by me. </p>
                    <p> "Did you want work?" he asked. </p>
                    <p> "Very much. </p>
                    <p> "What kind of work have you been doing?" </p>
                    <p> I admitted I had never worked in a factory, but told him I could sew and was
                        willing to do anything that would give me a living. </p>
                    <p> "Well, you ought to have a chance - a good chance if you are willing to work
                        - but it's dull just now and I don't see where we can put you. You say you
                        can sew. Run the machine, too? Well, we start our skirt and cloak rooms in a
                        couple of weeks and then we can try you." </p>
                    <p> "But I must have work," I persisted, "at once. </p>
                    <p><span class="omission"> *omission* </span></p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="change">Mr. W.</span> sighed a little and left me to see a
                        customer who had just then entered. While I was fixing up a romance in case
                        any inquiry was made as to my age, name, residence and position in life a
                        sad-faced Irish mother came up the four stories with a 16-year-old daughter.
                        They were as poorly dressed as myself, but considerably less happy. The
                        mother's hands were hard, thin and work-worn, and her face seamed with care.
                        She wore an old bonnet, a coarse black dress, poor shoes, an old shawl, and
                        an expression of injury, despondency and severity. Annie was a
                        well-developed girl, with a good, wholesome face, red cheeks, bright,
                        fun-loving eyes, big hands and feet, a most ungainly manner, and a nice
                        figure. She had been crying, for her lashes were wet, and she seemed
                        expectant that a crisis of some sort was near at hand. I soon learned that
                        the mother missed her calling when she adopted maternal duties. The family
                        lived in the region of Blue Island avenue and consisted of the parents and
                        growing children, two or three having married. Annie was the youngest and
                        "had to do something for her grub, " as the mother said. For a long, time
                        she worked in a box factory and made good wages, but the work was not
                        steady, and last January she came to <span class="change">W.'s</span> . </p>
                    <p> And what do you think she did? </p>
                    <p> She earned 80 cents a week cutting dress reeds from 7:30 o'clock in the
                        morning until 5:30 in the evening. Annie will be 17 years old in September.
                        Here is her account of the work: </p>
                    <p> "Oh yes, I like it. They don't pay me much, but the <span class="change"
                            >fore-lady's</span> good to me, and <span class="change">Mr. ---</span>
                        is awful kind. The girls is nice, too. The only thing I don't like is that
                        they're always cuttin' me down. I can't make hardly nothing." </p>
                    <p> "Last week? Oh, last week I wasn't here. I staid home. It was so hot I
                        didn't want to take the trouble to come down for 13 cents a day and walk and
                        put up my lunch." </p>
                    <p> Thinking the girl's calculations were amiss I turned to the mother, who
                        confirmed the statement, adding: "It don't pay to feed that kid to work on
                        the pay she's getting." </p>
                    <p> "It's what all the girl's gets," added Annie, beginning to cry. I played
                        mother for a little while, told her she was a good girl to help her parents
                        and not to mind, for there was plenty of work, and if she comes to <span
                            class="change">the <em>Times</em></span> I'll help her get it. </p>
                    <p> After the Irish gray eyes had been dried with both corners of her little
                        black shawl she gave me the prices at which she had been working. Here they
                        are: </p>
                    <p> One cent a gross for cutting steels in eleven, fifteen and eighteen inch
                        length. The work is done by machine, the operator using one foot and both
                        hands constantly. </p>
                    <p> Four cents a gross for sewing buckles on bustles. </p>
                    <p> Three cents a dozen for basting bustles. </p>
                    <p> Four cents a dozen for springing bustles. </p>
                    <p> Seventy cents a dozen for putting elastics on reeds and boxing the same. </p>
                    <p> Wages in this department vary from 60 cents to $3 a week, $1.50 being a very
                        fair average, and this, too, for girls of 19 years and less. </p>
                    <p> When the manager had dismissed his guest he waited on Annie's mother, who
                        turned traitress, betraying her own child to the enemy in this style: </p>
                    <p> "Can Annie come back, sir?" she asked. </p>
                    <p> "Why, I guess so. What's been the matter?" </p>
                    <p> Annie rolled her finger up in black fringe, hung her head, and allowed the
                        tears to stream down her cheeks. </p>
                    <p> "Oh she's so sassy," kindly volunteered the mother, "and she comes home to
                        me with a batch of stories every night about your cuttin' down the prices.
                        Sure I can't believe a word she says." </p>
                    <p> "Well, you come in the morning, Annie, and I'll see what we can do for you."
                        With this dismissal, poor Annie followed her mother, who doubtless felt that
                        she had done her duty by the child. </p>
                    <p> I recited my piece to the low-voiced gentleman, who said there was plenty of
                        work in the bustle department, but he guessed it wouldn't be pleasant for
                        me, as the girls were only sixteen or so. I tried to assure him that I
                        didn't care about the company, that I only wanted a chance to make a living
                        for myself. </p>
                    <p> "Well, I don't think you could earn enough to support yourself at machine
                        work. Come in about Monday and I <span class="change">thin</span> we can
                        give you something at $3 or so." </p>
                    <p> "Three dollars a week?" </p>
                    <p> "Yes." </p>
                    <p> "God have mercy on the girls," I said reverently and departed. </p>

                    <p class="addition">In Chicago according to the statements given with names and
                        places by the <em>Times</em> newspaper, the conditions are as bad. In many
                        places where women work there is not even a pretense of cleanliness. It is
                        proven that in one factory the women are locked in without any possi-bility
                        of leaving the room for any purpose. When the knitting girls struck in St.
                        Louis, it was shown that in some cases prostitution was one of the
                        conditions of getting and keeping work, and that many girls could not make
                        enough money to buy bread and fuel wuthout resorting to the streets. It is
                        the general custom in almost all places to discipline women workers by
                        fining them for an infraction of the rules, and there are many instances on
                        record where the fines have taken up the whole of the week's wages although
                        the employer got the whole of the week's work. Can anyone wonder that out of
                        2,000 women of the town in New York, 1,820 had been working girls before
                        they took to the streets? Can anyone wonder why Madison street, in Chicago,
                        is nightly crowded with unfortuuates?</p>
                    <p class="addition">But it will be well to give here in detail some of the
                        results of the Times investigations of the conditions surrounding female
                        labor in Chicago. They have additional value from the fact that they were
                        made for a responsible newspaper by a woman who shows in every line of her
                        work her fitness for the task. It has not been deemed advisable here to give
                        the names of the firms and corporations but those sufliciently interested
                        may peruse the files of the Chicago <em>Times</em> beginning with July 30,
                        1888, and there read the articles under the heading "City Slave Girls,"
                        which should make the <em>nom de plume</em> of the writer, "Nell Nelson,"
                        forever dear to all toiling womankind:</p>
                    <p class="addition">Tuesday July 10, according to instructions, I made up for
                        the role of shop girl, and with a list of factories in one hand, and gentle
                        peace in the other, sailed down town under a brown baize veil as
                        impene-trable as an iron mask.</p>
                    <ul class="headlines">
                        <li><span class="omission"> *headlines: omitted* </span></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p> I did not realize the ignominious position of respectable poverty till I
                            <span class="change">reached a cloak factory on Madison street</span> ,
                        where labor is bondage, the laboror a slave, and flesh and blood cheaper
                        than needles and thread. Corporations are said to be without heart, but this
                        concern is a commercial inquisition. It puts its help on the plane of
                        slavery, and nothing but civil law prevents the use of the lash. </p>
                    <p> The factory is on the third floor of the large brick building <span
                            class="change">.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p> Elevator? Not much. </p>
                    <p> An elevator is a luxury, and luxuries have no place <span class="change"
                            >here</span> . You will be short of breath when you reach the top of the
                        fourth flight, but in recovering you have time to take in the surroundings -
                        a great barn of a place with a single charm of good light. There is plenty
                        of vacant room, but the women are huddled together, elbows touching along
                        the line of machines. Beneath the west windows flows the river; at the south
                        end of the room, not ten feet from the crowded table, is a tier of closets,
                        and on hot days the combined odor of the two is shocking. Nobody in his
                        employ dare complain about smells, cold, heat, work, wages or rules. But
                            <span class="change">who-ever</span> heard of martyrs complaining? </p>

                    <p> My experience began at 7:50 <span class="change">a.m.</span> and lasted just
                        three hours. When I climbed the dusty stairs I took a ten-minute rest at the
                        top. Everybody was at work but a hungry-looking man about 27 years old, with
                        skin the color of a Russia turnip and thin, peaked features. He was dressed
                        in a pair of heel-less slippers, a white shirt, and a pair of shop pants
                        that a clothing store pays 18 cents for making. Neither collar, vest, coat
                        nor suspenders burdened his emaciated form. He moved among the workers with
                        a cat-like tread, his shoulders drooping and his knees opening and shutting
                        with a sort of accordion movement at every step. He passed me several times
                        as I stood at the desk and eyed me so unpleasantly that I turned my back to
                        him. </p>
                    <p> After waiting at the desk for three-quarters of an hour, I asked the clerk,
                        a sweet little girl of 16 years, with pretty red cheeks and dark eyelashes
                        and hair, for work, and was told to wait till the forelady came round. A
                        dozen girls were waiting, too, some with cloaks, others with check-books and
                        tickets, and a few with hand-made fringe. The fringe-girl I spoke to. She
                        told me she received 5 cents a yard for making an imitation of seal-ball
                        fringe, such as winter cloaks are trimmed with. She had a piece three yards
                        and a quarter long that had taken her all the previous day to make. Here was
                        a child of 15 working nine and a half hours a day for a competence of 16 1/4

                    <p> Maggie's fringe being measured and her book checked, she was given another
                        box of material and went off to weave it into tassel-trimming. The girl who
                        took her place would not be interviewed. She didn't know how much stitchers
                        earned and wouldn't tell how much a week she could make." She was, possibly,
                        25 years old, with a deathly pale face, and looked as if she hadn't eaten
                        any breakfast. Her successor was less reticent. "I'm here since May, but I
                        don't like it; the boss is a horrid thing. Him and the forelady watches us
                        all the time, and they don't give us hardly any work. I can only make one
                        cloak a day; some pays 30 cents, some 40 cents, and some 50 cents. Yesterday
                        I had only 60 cents coming to me for two days. Are you long here? Oh, you
                        won't stay. They search your bag and your pocket when you go home nights to
                        see if you have any thread or pieces about you." </p>

                            assigned to a place in the work-room and given a good-sized bundle of

                            15 cents, and you get 30 cents for finishing, if the work is

                            plush; the sleeves had to go in-eighteen button-holes to be worked and a
                            corresponding number of but-tons sewed on, and the seams and edges faced
                            with black muslin. Thirty cents, in other words, for a good day's work

                    <p> I did not realize the ignominious position of respectable poverty till I
                        went to Ellinger's cloak factory, 282 Madison street , where labor is
                        bondage, the laboror a slave, and flesh and blood cheaper than needles and
                        thread. Corporations are said to be without heart, but this concern is a
                        commercial inquisition. It puts its help on the plane of slavery, and
                        nothing but civil law prevents the use of the lash. </p>
                    <p> The factory is on the third floor of the large brick building at the east
                        end of Madison street bridge on the south side of the street. </p>
                    <p> Elevator? Not much. </p>
                    <p> An elevator is a luxury, and luxuries have no place at Ellinger's . You will
                        be short of breath when you reach the top of the fourth flight, but in
                        recovering you have time to take in the surroundings - a great barn of a
                        place with a single charm of good light. There is plenty of vacant room, but
                        the women are huddled together, elbows touching along the line of machines.
                        Beneath the west windows flows the river; at the south end of the room, not
                        ten feet from the crowded table, is a tier of closets, and on hot days the
                        combined odor of the two is shocking. Nobody in his employ dare complain
                        about smells, cold, heat, work, wages or rules. But whoever heard of martyrs
                        complaining? </p>

                    <p> My experience began at 7:50 a.m. and lasted just three hours. When I climbed
                        the dusty stairs I took a ten-minute rest at the top. Everybody was at work
                        but a hungry-looking man about 27 years old, with skin the color of a Russia
                        turnip and thin, peaked features. He was dressed in a pair of heel-less
                        slippers, a white shirt, and a pair of shop pants that a clothing store pays
                        18 cents for making. Neither collar, vest, coat nor suspenders burdened his
                        emaciated form. He moved among the workers with a cat-like tread, his
                        shoulders drooping and his knees opening and shutting with a sort of
                        accordion movement at every step. He passed me several times as I stood at
                        the desk and eyed me so unpleasantly that I turned my back to him. </p>
                    <p> After waiting at the desk for three-quarters of an hour, I asked the clerk,
                        a sweet little girl of 16 years, with pretty red cheeks and dark eyelashes
                        and hair, for work, and was told to wait till the forelady came round. A
                        dozen girls were waiting, too, some with cloaks, others with check-books and
                        tickets, and a few with hand-made fringe. The fringe-girl I spoke to. She
                        told me she received 5 cents a yard for making an imitation of seal-ball
                        fringe, such as winter cloaks are trimmed with. She had a piece three yards
                        and a quarter long that had taken her all the previous day to make. Here was
                        a child of 15 working nine and a half hours a day for a competence of 16 1/4
                        cents. Will the Prairie avenue woman, who, at the suggestion of Mrs. Ormison
                        Chant, is trying to find one hundred girls who are earning less than 28

                        snake-gaited, jaundice-faced creature who has charge of this human mill. </p>
                    <p> Maggie's fringe being measured and her book checked, she was given another
                        box of material and went off to weave it into tassel-trimming. The girl who
                        took her place would not be interviewed. She didn't know how much stitchers
                        earned and wouldn't tell how much a week she could make." She was, possibly,
                        25 years old, with a deathly pale face, and looked as if she hadn't eaten
                        any breakfast. Her successor was less reticent. "I'm here since May, but I
                        don't like it; the boss is a horrid thing. Him and the forelady watches us
                        all the time, and they don't give us hardly any work. I can only make one
                        cloak a day; some pays 30 cents, some 40 cents, and some 50 cents. Yesterday
                        I had only 60 cents coming to me for two days. Are you long here? Oh, you
                        won't stay. They search your bag and your pocket when you go home nights to
                        see if you have any thread or pieces about you." </p>
                    <p> </p>
                    <p> Before I had a chance to talk with another unfortunate the little
                        rosy-cheeked clerk told me "it's against the rules for new hands to stand
                        here. You must go over by the stairs and wait till the forelady comes." I
                        smiled at the pretty child and she rewarded me by bringing a chair to me a
                        few minutes later. All means of communication being cut off I amused myself
                        making sketches of the shirted, slippered, sleuth-like creature as he
                        passed. </p>
                    <p> This pastime was interrupted by the appearance of a fat woman. She had on a
                        black sateen suit that fitted her puffy figure like the raiment of a
                        well-boiled suet pudding. She carried herself like a drum major on a dress
                        parade and by way of ornaments wore a gold watch with a double coil of gold
                        chain at her belt, gold earrings, a gold breast pin, gold cuff-buttons and
                        two gold rings. Bigger than bust or bustle was the woman's head I discovered
                        when I asked: </p>
                    <p> "Are you the forewoman?" </p>
                    <p> "Forelady, yes. What do you want?" </p>
                    <p> "Work." </p>
                    <p> "What can you do?" </p>
                    <p> "Sew." </p>
                    <p> "Where have you been working?" </p>
                    <p> " Never-Rip company. " </p>

                    <p> "Want to stitch?" </p>
                    <p> "No, I would rather finish." </p>
                    <p> "Give your name to the clerk." </p>
                    <p> I complied and was entered on his book as the resident of a vacant lot on
                        Monroe street. The forewoman selected a bundle as big as a Kamschatka baby
                        from a mountain of bundles and said: </p>
                    <p> "Here, go over there and wait till I come." </p>
                    <p> "How much do you pay for this class of work?" </p>
                    <p> "I don't know. It seems to me you're mighty particular." </p>
                    <p> "If you don't know who does?" I asked. </p>
                    <p> "You make me dizzy," she said, dropping the bundle and giving me a look of
                        intense disgust. She took a small book from her pocket containing the
                        price-list and asked me what number. </p>
                    <p> "I don't know." </p>
                    <p> "Look." </p>
                    <p> "Where?" </p>
                    <p> "You'll come down a peg or two before long," and with a groan she bent over
                        the bundle at her feet, flushed apoplectically and said "360." Referring
                        again to her price-list: "Them's sixty-five cents," and left me. </p>
                    <p> I raised that 65-cent ulster, and with my arms folded about the fuzzy,
                        ill-smelling thing, moved "down there," as directed, and halted at the edge
                        of a huge rag-box. Here I stood for twenty minutes, when the forewoman came
                        aft and bade me "this way." I pursued. There was a halt about the middle of
                        the shop and I seized it for a "scoop." </p>
                    <p> "How many girls have you here?" </p>
                    <p> "Never counted them." </p>
                    <p> "What can experienced cloak hands earn in a day?" </p>
                    <p> "Never asked them." </p>
                    <p> "How much of your salary is for politeness?" </p>
                    <p> "You can sit here," pointing to a cane chair with half the seat gone. "That
                        girl with the black dress will do your stitching; the one at the end of the
                        second table will bind the seams, and Annie down there in brown calico -
                        she's fixing the machine now - will give you any help," and she was off. </p>
                    <p> "I beg your pardon, did I understand you to say I would get sixty-five cents
                        for making this cloak?" following her. </p>
                    <p> "Now your're just a little bit too fresh. If you don't want the work, say
                        so." </p>
                    <p> "I do want the work, but I want to know what it will pay first." </p>
                    <p> "This is a 65-cent cloak. Do you get that through your head? The stitcher
                        gets 20 cents, the binder gets 15 cents, and you get 30 cents for finishing
                        if the work is right. If it isn't, you get out." </p>
                    <p> I thanked her and was alone. Here I thought lay my fortune. Thirty cents for
                        making a long cloth cloak, after the seams were stitched. It had to be
                        trimed down the back gores around the collar, cuffs, and pockets with mohair
                        plush; the sleeves had to go in, eighteen buttons sewed on, eighteen holes
                        worked, and all the seams and edges faced with black muslin. Thirty cents!
                        To save my life I couldn't have finished the garment in ten hours. I was
                        just reaching that conclusion when the forewoman appeared with a small book,
                        two checks, and a piece of tailor's chalk as big as a dime. </p>
                    <p> "Your number is 180; chalk it on all these pieces and if you lose any you
                        will be fined." </p>
                    <p> "How much?" </p>
                    <p> "How much? You cheeky thing! The cost of the cloth and the cutter's time.
                        That's how much. Give this check to the binder and that one to the
                        stitcher." </p>
                    <p> "Will you please tell me how this side gore goes?" </p>
                    <p> "Go to Annie. I ain't here to learn you how to sew." </p>
                    <p> "May I have a needle?" </p>
                    <p> "Furnish your own needles." </p>

                    <p> "May I have basting cotton?" </p>
                    <p> "There aint any. You have to wait till it gets here." </p>
                    <p> I gave a girl a penny for a needle and stole some thread from an absentee's
                        stock. Then I waited fifteen minutes while the binder got through and basted
                        up the seams for the stitcher. That much done I got to work on the plush.
                        The forewoman passed by and told me I was not "showing enough fur. Go over
                        to the sample and look at the work." </p>
                    <p> She sneered when I asked her where the samples were, but a neighbor
                        volunteered the information. There was no sample on the rack and I stepped
                        over to inform the forewoman, who curtly told me it was none of her affair. </p>
                    <p> "Will you please tell me how wide to make this trimming?" </p>
                    <p> "Go to Annie." </p>
                    <p> Poor Annie was doctoring a machine and said "in a minute." On her way to me
                        three stitchers implored her to look at their miserable implements and I
                        waited patiently till I caught sight of the forewoman looking at her bangs
                        in a handglass. Apologizing for the intrusion I asked her if the sample had
                        come yet. </p>
                    <p> "No." </p>
                    <p> "I wish you would kindly show me how wide to make this trimming." </p>
                    <p> "Go to Annie, I told you." </p>
                    <p> "Annie is too busy. She's mending machines." </p>
                    <p> "Well, I won't be bothered with you." </p>
                    <p> "What's the reason you won't?" </p>
                    <p> "Cause I won't" </p>
                    <p> "Well you will. Tell me how wide you want this plush or I will see Mr.
                        Ellinger. </p>
                    <p> "See him. I don't care. There he is," pointing to the snaky, half-starved
                        creature whose shanks I had been sketching and on whom I had scornfully
                        turned my back. It was too much to ask of a free-born American woman to
                        recognize the <span class="correct">superiority</span> of such a person. He
                        came up to us in an instant. The forewoman was livid with rage and she began
                        to talk as fast as her tongue could move. Some fifty or more girls heard the
                        tirade breathlessly. Before the half-dressed proprietor had a chance to get
                        over his astonishment I threw the front of the cloak at his face, the side
                        body at the forewoman, and walked off to my disabled chair with Mr. Ellinger
                        for a bodyguard. He was the color of a sanitarium babe when we reached my
                        work table. He had the two pieces of cloak in his hand, and when he raised
                        his fist to strike me I worked up an Indian-club attitude and dared him. </p>
                    <p> He escorted me to the toilet-room, where I went for my hat and jacket, and
                        before slamming the door in his face by way of a hint as to the privacy of
                        the place I threw my needle and thread at him. A. Ellinger saw me across the
                        shop and down the first flight of stairs. And there ended my first
                        experience in a cloak factory. </p>

                    </ul>
                    <p> I next made application for work at Wetherell's , on Wabash avenue, where
                        hundreds of girls are employed on corsets, bustles, skirts, jerseys and
                        cloaks. Boarding the freight elevator I was drawn up to the top floor, where
                        a pretty little Jewess informed me that Mr. Saalsbery was engaged, but would
                        see me in a little while. She showed me to a seat in the rear end of the
                        store at the entrance to the shop-room, and for a single hour I listened to
                        the drop, drop, drop of the heavy machinery and the snatches of song and
                        merriment between the iron roar. Presently Mr. Wetherell came and sat by me. </p>
                    <p> "Did you want work?" he asked. </p>
                    <p> "Very much. </p>
                    <p> "What kind of work have you been doing?" </p>
                    <p> I admitted I had never worked in a factory, but told him I could sew and was
                        willing to do anything that would give me a living. </p>
                    <p> "Well, you ought to have a chance - a good chance if you are willing to work
                        - but it's dull just now and I don't see where we can put you. You say you
                        can sew. Run the machine, too? Well, we start our skirt and cloak rooms in a
                        couple of weeks and then we can try you." </p>
                    <p> "But I must have work," I persisted, "at once. I can't wait two weeks." </p>
                    <p> Mr. Wetherell sighed a little and left me to see a customer who had just
                        then entered. While I was fixing up a romance in case any inquiry was made
                        as to my age, name, residence and position in life a sad-faced Irish mother
                        came up the four stories with a 16-year-old daughter. They were as poorly
                        dressed as myself, but considerably less happy. The mother's hands were
                        hard, thin and work-worn, and her face seamed with care. She wore an old
                        bonnet, a coarse black dress, poor shoes, an old shawl, and an expression of
                        injury, despondency and severity. Annie was a well-developed girl, with a
                        good, wholesome face, red cheeks, bright, fun-loving eyes, big hands and
                        feet, a most ungainly manner, and a nice figure. She had been crying, for
                        her lashes were wet, and she seemed expectant that a crisis of some sort was
                        near at hand. I soon learned that the mother missed her calling when she
                        adopted maternal duties. The family lived in the region of Blue Island
                        avenue and consisted of the parents and growing children, two or three
                        having married. Annie was the youngest and "had to do something for her
                        grub, " as the mother said. For a long, time she worked in a box factory and
                        made good wages, but the work was not steady, and last January she came to
                        Wetherell's . </p>
                    <p> And what do you think she did? </p>
                    <p> She earned 80 cents a week cutting dress reeds from 7:30 o'clock in the
                        morning until 5:30 in the evening. Annie will be 17 years old in September.
                        Here is her account of the work: </p>
                    <p> "Oh yes, I like it. They don't pay me much, but the forelady's good to me,
                        and Mr. Saalsbery is awful kind. The girls is nice, too. The only thing I
                        don't like is that they're always cuttin' me down. I can't make hardly
                        nothing." </p>
                    <p> "Last week? Oh, last week I wasn't here. I staid home. It was so hot I
                        didn't want to take the trouble to come down for 13 cents a day and walk and
                        put up my lunch." </p>
                    <p> Thinking the girl's calculations were amiss I turned to the mother, who
                        confirmed the statement, adding: "It don't pay to feed that kid to work on
                        the pay she's getting." </p>
                    <p> "It's what all the girl's gets," added Annie, beginning to cry. I played
                        mother for a little while, told her she was a good girl to help her parents
                        and not to mind, for there was plenty of work, and if she comes to THE TIMES
                        I'll help her get it. </p>
                    <p> After the Irish gray eyes had been dried with both corners of her little
                        black shawl she gave me the prices at which she had been working. Here they
                        are: </p>
                    <p> One cent a gross for cutting steels in eleven, fifteen and eighteen inch
                        length. The work is done by machine, the operator using one foot and both
                        hands constantly. </p>
                    <p> Four cents a gross for sewing buckles on bustles. </p>
                    <p> Three cents a dozen for basting bustles. </p>
                    <p> Four cents a dozen for springing bustles. </p>
                    <p> Seventy cents a dozen for putting elastics on reeds and boxing the same. </p>
                    <p> Wages in this department vary from 60 cents to $3 a week, $1.50 being a very
                        fair average, and this, too, for girls of 19 years and less. </p>
                    <p> When the manager had dismissed his guest he waited on Annie's mother, who
                        turned traitress, betraying her own child to the enemy in this style: </p>
                    <p> "Can Annie come back, sir?" she asked. </p>
                    <p> "Why, I guess so. What's been the matter?" </p>
                    <p> Annie rolled her finger up in black fringe, hung her head, and allowed the
                        tears to stream down her cheeks. </p>
                    <p> "Oh she's so sassy," kindly volunteered the mother, "and she comes home to
                        me with a batch of stories every night about your cuttin' down the prices.
                        Sure I can't believe a word she says." </p>
                    <p> "Well, you come in the morning, Annie, and I'll see what we can do for you."
                        With this dismissal, poor Annie followed her mother, who doubtless felt that
                        she had done her duty by the child. </p>
                    <p> I recited my piece to the low-voiced gentleman, who said there was plenty of
                        work in the bustle department, but he guessed it wouldn't be pleasant for
                        me, as the girls were only sixteen or so. I tried to assure him that I
                        didn't care about the company, that I only wanted a chance to make a living
                        for myself. </p>
                    <p> "Well, I don't think you could earn enough to support yourself at machine
                        work. Come in about Monday and I think we can give you something at $3 or
                        so." </p>
                    <p> "Three dollars a week?" </p>
                    <p> "Yes." </p>
                    <p> "God have mercy on the girls," I said reverently and departed. </p>
                    <p> NELL NELSON. </p>

                        <h5>CHICAGO, July 30 - TO THE EDITOR:</h5>
                        <p>Oh, how long have I looked for a friendly hand to be extended in behalf
                            of the poor working girls of this city. African slavery in the south
                            never could, I think, compare with the white slavery of Chicago. What
                            are we living for? That's the question. Here I am, working as a
                            type-writer for a millionaire and getting $3 a week. If such men are not
                            to be punished in this world then I can only cherish the hope that there
                            is another, where punishment will be meted out to them. Whoever
                            connected with your paper too this bold stand to right the wrongs of the
                            hard-worked, industrious, poor girls of this city may heaven bless him.
                            Could I but declare myself and make known the indignities to which I
                            have been subjected the earth might better for them open and swallow up
                            the accursed. My prayer is that your valuable paper will leave no
                            inquiry unsatisfied, but will fearlessly and to the point strike for the
                            rights and the life of the girls; and I hope to see the business men of
                            Chicago aroused to a proper sense of their
                            meanness.<br /><em>MARY.</em></p>
                        <h5>CHICAGO, July 30 - TO THE EDITOR:</h5>
                        <p>Your exposure of "Life Among the Slave Girls of Chicago" ought to awaken
                            a deep interest among our people. Who can forget that memorable
                            utterance of Horace Greeley: "I am glad to have lived in that day and
                            generation which gave the deathblow to American slavery and to
                            imprisonment for debt." But today we have another and most damnable
                            system of slavery carried on for the greed of people at the expense of
                            life and health, virtue, home, and, it may be, heaven. This hideous
                            crime practiced upon defenseless woman is all to make the "rich richer
                            and the poor poorer." It must come to an end. The thought of this state
                            of things must some day burn the hearts or sting the conscience of our
                            commercial people. 'Tis a shame and disgrace, and I hope your articles
                            will be the means of calling effectual attention to
                                it.<br /><em>J.W.B.</em></p>
