        <p>In Chicago according to the statements given with names and places by the <em>Times</em> newspaper, the conditions are as bad. In many places where women work there is not even a pretense of cleanliness. It is proven that in one factory the women are locked in without any possi-bility of leaving the room for any purpose. When the knitting girls struck in St. Louis, it was shown that in some cases prostitution was one of the conditions of getting and keeping work, and that many girls could not make enough money to buy bread and fuel wuthout resorting to the streets. It is the general custom in almost all places to discipline women workers by fining them for an infraction of the rules, and there are many instances on record where the fines have taken up the whole of the week's wages although the employer got the whole of the week's work. Can anyone wonder that out of 2,000 women of the town in New York, 1,820 had been working girls before they took to the streets? Can anyone wonder why Madison street, in Chicago, is nightly crowded with unfortuuates?</p>
        <p>But it will be well to give here in detail some of the results of the Times investigations of the conditions surrounding female labor in Chicago. They have additional value from the fact that they were made for a responsible newspaper by a woman who shows in every line of her work her fitness for the task. It has not been deemed advisable here to give the names of the firms and corporations but those sufliciently interested may peruse the files of the Chicago <em>Times</em> beginning with July 30, 1888, and there read the articles under the heading "City Slave Girls," which should make the <em>nom de plume</em> of the writer, "Nell Nelson," forever dear to all toiling womankind :</p>
        <p>Tuesday July 10, according to instructions, I made up for the role of shop girl, and with a list of factories in one hand, and gentle peace in the other, sailed down town under a brown baize veil as impene-trable as an iron mask.</p>
        <p>I did not realize the ignominious position of respectable poverty till I reached a cloak factory on Madison street, where labor is bondage, the laborer a slave, and flesh and blood cheaper than needles and thread. Corporations are said to be without heart but this concern is a commercial inquisition. It puts its help on the plane of slavery, and n,othing but civil law prevents the use of the lash.</p>
        <p>The factory is on the third floor of a large brick building.</p>
        <p>Elevator? No, indeed. An elevator is a luxury, and luxuries have no place here. You will be short of breath when you reach the top of the fourth flight but in recovering you have time to take in the</p>

        <p>surroundings-a great barn of a place, with the single charm of good light. There is plenty of vacant room, but the women are huddled together, elbows touching, along the line of machines. Into the west windows pours the odor of Chicago's famous sewer river; at the south end of the room, not ten feet from the crowded table, is a tier of closets, and on hot days the combined odor of the two is shocking. Nobody dare complain about smells, cold, heat, work, wages or rules. But who-ever heard of martyrs complaining?</p>
        <p>My experience began at 7:50 a.m. and lasted just three hours. When I climbed the dusty stairs I took a ten-minute rest at the top. Every-body was at work but a hungry looking man about twenty-seven years old, with skin the color of a Russia turnip, and thin, peaked features. He was dressed in a pair of heelless slippers, a white shirt, and a pair of shop pants that some poor slave had received eighteen cents for making. Neither collar, vest, coat, nor suspenders burdened his emaciated form. He moved among the workers with a cat like tread, his shoulders drooping and his knees opening and shutting with a sort of accordion movement at every step. He passed me several times as I stood at the desk, and eyed me so unpleasantly that I turned my back to him.</p>
        <p>After waiting at the desk for three-quarters of an hour, I asked the clerk, a sweet little girl of sixteen years, with pretty red cheeks and dark eyelashes and hair, for work, and was told to wait till the forelady came round. A dozen girls were waiting, too, some with cloaks, others with check-books and tickets, and a few with hand made fringe.  The fringe girl I spoke to. She told me she received 5 cents a yard for making an imitation of seal-ball fringe, such as winter cloaks are trimmed with. She had a piece three yards and a quarter long that had taken her all the previous day to make. Here was a child of fifteen working nine and a half hours a day for a competence of 16 1/4 cents. Will the Prairie Avenue woman who, at the suggestion of Mrs. Ormison Chant, is trying to find a hundred girls who are earning less than 28 cents a day, please enter Maggie W- on the list, and will the women of the Protective Agency who want a new field of inquiry, call and see the slim, snake-gaited, jaundice-faced creature who has charge of this human mill?</p>
        <p>Maggie's fringe being measured and her book checked, she was given another box of material, and went off to weave it into tassel-trimming. The girl who took her place would not be interviewed. She "didn t know how much stitchers earned, and wouldn t tell nobody how much a week she could make." She was, possibly, twenty five years old with a deathly pale face, and looked as though she hadn't eaten any breakfast.</p>

        <p>Her successor was less reticent. "I'm here since May, but I don t like it. The boss is a horrid thing. Him and the forelady watches us all the time, and they don't give us hardly any work. I can only make one cloak a day; some pays 30 cents, some 40 cents, and some 50 cents. Yesterday I had 60 cents coming to me for two days. Are you long here? Oh, you won't stay. They search your bag and your pockets when you go home nights to see if you have any thread or pieces about you."</p>
        <p>After waiting an hour the disguised investigator was properly enrolled among the toilers of this particular cloak factory, assigned to a place in the work-room and given a good-sized bundle of material, which was to be made into a garment.</p>
            <p>"This is a 65-cent cloak," said the hard-featured spinster who acted as forelady. "The stitcher gets 20 cents, the binder 15 cents, and you get 30 cents for finishing, if the work is right." Here was, indeed, a fortune! Thirty cents for making a long cloth cloak after the seams were stitched. It had to be trimmed down the back gores, around the collar, cuffs and pockets with mohair plush; the sleeves had to go in-eighteen button-holes to be worked and a corresponding number of but-tons sewed on, and the seams and edges faced with black muslin. Thirty cents, in other words, for a good day's work of ten hours!</p>
