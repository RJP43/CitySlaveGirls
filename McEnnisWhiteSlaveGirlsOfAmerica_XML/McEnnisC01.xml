        <p>EVERY year the scope of female labor is becoming broader, the number of laborers larger,
            the skill and the effectiveness of the working-women greater, but, unfortunately the
            condition of the women who win their bread has not improved. They are for the most part
                <desc type="livingConditions">badly housed</desc>, <desc type="livingConditions">insufficiently fed</desc>, <desc type="livingConditions">shabbily clothed</desc> and
                <desc type="wageDesc">poorly paid</desc>. The trades and the callings
            requiring skilled labor in which women are now employed in this country are mainly in

            In the making <pb n="14"/> of each of these articles the reader will perceive that the
            demand has brought about the supply. <desc type="womensLabor">There was need in each case for the manual
            dexterity, the light and careful touch and the patient and tireless application which we
            recognize as the chief advantages of women’s work.</desc> For this peculiar ability, however,
            it is unfortnnately true that the women are the <desc type="wageDesc">worst paid
                laborers</desc> in <placeName>America</placeName>. They receive <desc type="wageDesc">shamefully low wages</desc>, and the conditions under which
            they work are disgraceful to our boasted civilization. For instance, 
            <ref type="occupation">braid-makers</ref> average <num type="wage" value="5.50">$5.50</num> a week;
            <ref type="occupation">vest-makers</ref>, <num type="wage" value="6.00">$6.00</num>;
            <ref type="occupation">button-hole makers</ref>, <num type="wage" value="4.30">$4.30</num>;
            <ref type="occupation">candy- makers</ref>, <num type="wage" value="4.75">$4.75</num>;
            <ref type="occupation">cap-makers</ref>, <num type="wage" value="5.50">$5.50</num>;<ref type="occupation">tobacco-strippers</ref>, <num type="wage" value="5.50">$5.50</num>; <ref type="occupation">cigar-makers</ref>, <num type="wage" value="5.00">$5.00</num>;
            <ref type="occupation">dressmakers</ref>, <num type="wage" value="5.00">$5.00</num>;
            <ref type="occupation">hatters</ref>, <num type="wage" value="6.00">$6.00</num>; <ref type="occupation">ladies’
                hat makers</ref>, <num type="wage" value="4.00">$4.00</num>;<ref type="occupation">paper-
                    makers</ref>, <num type="wage" value="5.00">$5.00</num>;
            <ref type="occupation">rag-sorters</ref>, <num type="wage" value="3.50">$3.50</num>;
            <ref type="occupation">shirt-makers</ref>, <num type="wage" value="6.00">$6.00</num>. 
            These figures, however, come from first-class
            establishments, which are not afraid to expose their methods of working to the light of
            day; establishments which, unfortunately, are in a helpless minority among the employers
            of female labor. The writer believes, from a careful study of all the facts to which he
            could get access, that the <desc type="wageDesc">average wage for female skilled labor in
                this country, throughout, is somewhere between <num type="wage" value="4.50">$4.50</num> and <num type="wage" value="5.00">$5.00</num> a
        week, and the average time worked is something
            more than ten hours a day</desc>. The reason is plain: <desc type="womensLabor">female labor is not organized,
            it is perfectly helpless, and the weakest, under the beneficent and kindly law of
            nature, goes to the wall.</desc> </p>
        <p> There are classes of work done by women whose conditions can not in justice be
            criticised as can the so-called skilled labor, and which are, if not too well paid, at
            least comfortable, healthy, and proper; chief among these is domestic
                service, in which, in <date when="1888">1888</date>, more than 1,200,000
                females are employed. <desc type="wageDesc">Their wages run between <num type="wage" value="10.00">$10</num> and <num type="wage" value="14.00">$14</num> a month some, of course, ranging
                as high as <num type="wage" value="25.00">$25</num> and <num type="wage" value="30.00">$30</num>, and few falling below
                    <num type="wage" value="10.00">$10</num>, so that <num type="wage" value="12.00">$12</num> is a conservative general
                average. To this is of course to be added board and lodging and perquisites, easily
                worth <num type="wage" value="20.00">$20</num> a month more</desc>. The <ref type="occupation">domestic
                servant</ref> is, as a rule, <desc type="livingConditions">well fed</desc>,
            <desc type="livingConditions">cleanly and comfortably lodged</desc>, and fairly treated; but <desc type="womensLabor">the idea of household work is so
            repugnant to many women that they prefer the starvation wages of the trades and the
            unwholesome crowding of the tenements</desc>. <ref type="industry">Laundresses and hotel
                servants</ref> have also surroundings and lives better for than anything to be
            found in the factories, but here, too, <desc type="womensLabor">the objection of “menial service” applies, and
            most <ref type="nationality">American-born</ref> women will have none of
            it.</desc></p>
        <p> Up to within the past few years there was practically no recourse for an educated woman
            who had her own living to make save teaching. This 
            <pb n="15"/>
            list has also been extended, and <ref type="occupation">type-writing</ref>, which pays about <num type="wage" value="10.00">$10</num> a week, <ref type="occupation">stenography</ref> at an
                average of <num type="wage" value="12.00">$12</num>, and different kinds of
                <ref type="occupation">clerical work in stores, keeping books, cash, etc., and selling
                goods</ref>, which are paid for at the rate of from <num type="wage" value="5.50">$5.50</num> to <num type="wage" value="10.00">$10</num>, and sometimes <num type="wage" value="15.00">$15</num> a week, have been added to the list. So that on the whole there
            are now in <placeName>America</placeName> about one hundred separate callings bidding
            for female labor, out of which the woman who must win her bread may take her choice.
            That the theater for her endeavor has thus been widened is by itself a good thing. <desc type="womensLabor">The
            chance for self-help, the possibility of independence, lifts the sex up, and as the
            years come on we can expect to see the sphere of woman’s action broadening until it at
            last will include all of these industries, where tactual skill, delicate manipulation,
            and careful work are needed rather than strength.</desc> But before we congratulate ourselves
            too much upon the high civilization which this indicates, let, us look at the reverse of
            the picture.</p>
        <p>It is a fact that <desc type="womensLabor">female labor the world over is in a most pitiable condition; women are
            weak in every way, weak individually and weak in their lack of organization, and there
            are men ready at all times to take advantage of their weakness</desc>. In
                <placeName>London</placeName> <desc type="wageDesc">the average wage of the whole body of women workers
            is, according to official figures, less than <num type="wage" value="7">seven shillings</num> (<num type="wage" value="1.75">$1.75</num>) a week, and out of this sum the worker must find food for herself, rags to cover her, and a
                    place to stay when she is not struggling for these few paltry bits of silver</desc>.
            As to the effect, hear what the English factory inspector says as late
            as the <date when="1888-07-01">1st of July, 1888</date>: </p>
        <p>
            <quote>“Domestic workshops, as now extended, are a great evil.
                Instead of large factories and legally constituted
                    workshops we have thousands of domestic
                    workshops, dark, 
                        dirty and overcrowded, and which <desc type="womensLabor">can not be improved by factory legislation, for at the time of the passing of the act the present state of things could not have been
                contemplated. Let not keen competition bear the whole of the blame, but rather let
                the truth be spoken, to the credit of greediness, and an unconcern for the welfare of unskilled operatives</desc>. Our
                   <desc type="workingClass">female population are losing self-respect, for they
                have no hope of improvement, being unskilled operatives</desc>; <desc type="workingClass">they rush into extremes of the gratification of the senses</desc>, <desc type="workingClass">they frequent places where drink is supplied</desc>, and
                    <desc type="workingClass">where utterances are set to music provocative,
                    enticing and subtle, a luxurious yet sensuous gratification of untrained
                    minds</desc>, <desc type="workingClass">unrestrained when their small earnings
                    are paid</desc>; but in the end they are most assuredly the victims of the
                    voluptas empta dolore.”</quote>
        </p>
        <p> And in the factories the conditions are such that the most callous <pb n="16"/> reader
            must stand appalled at the details. In 424 factories where women were employed in
            <desc type="location">the east end of <placeName>London</placeName></desc>, sewer gas
                was present in dangerous quantities, and the
                sexes were huddled together without any attempt at decency. The places are described as foul and filthy. Among 600
                lost women who answered the questions put to them by the inspector, 511 had been
                factory operatives. The only wonder is that the proportion is not
            greater.</p>
        <p> But we are accustomed to look on <placeName>London</placeName> as a place in another
            world. How is it at home? Here is the condition in <placeName>New York</placeName>
            tabulated so that it may be seen at a glance:</p>

        <p>These are official figures, and the New York Labor Commissioner says
            officially of them: <quote>"It is not only proven that the sanitary condition such as to cause alarm, but
                    that, in an equally great proportion of the same buildings, means for prevention
                    and escape in case of fire are alarmingly deficient. And this is not all,
                nor is it, from certain standpoints, a fact calculated to arouse public sentiment
                and indignation to so great an extent, as the utter
                    lack of proper facilities for change of dress and the use of separate water
                    closets, as established by overwhelming testimony.“</quote></p>
        <pb n="17"/>
        <p><ref type="newspaperSeries">In <placeName>Chicago</placeName>, according to the statements given with names and
            places by the <ref type="theTimes">Times newspaper</ref>,
            the conditions are as bad.</ref> In many places where women work there is not even a pretense
            of cleanliness. It is proven that in one factory the women
                are locked in without any possibility of leaving the room for any purpose.
            When the <ref type="occupation">knitting girls</ref> struck in <placeName>St.
                Louis</placeName>, it was shown that in some cases <desc type="workingClass">prostitution was one of the conditions of getting and keeping work, and that many
                girls could not make enough money to buy bread and fuel without resorting to the
                streets</desc>. It is the general custom in almost all
                places to discipline women workers by fining them for an infraction of the rules,
                and there are many instances on record where the fines have taken up the whole of
                the week's wages, although the employer got the whole of the week’s work. Can
            anyone wonder that out of 2,000 women of the town in <placeName>New
                    York</placeName>, 1,820 had been working girls before they took to,the
                streets? <desc type="workingClass">Can anyone wonder why
                    <desc type="location">Madison street, in <placeName>Chicago</placeName></desc>, is nightly crowded with unfortunates</desc>? </p>
        <p>But it will be well to give here in detail some of the results of <ref type="newspaperSeries">the <ref type="theTimes">Times</ref>' investigations of the
                conditions surrounding female labor in <placeName>Chicago</placeName></ref>. They have additional value
            from the fact that they were made for <ref type="theTimes">a responsible newspaper</ref> by <ref type="nellNelson">a woman who shows in every line of her work her fitness for the task</ref>. <ref type="newspaperSeries">It has not
                been deemed advisable here to give the names of the firms and corporations, but
                those sufficiently interested may peruse the files of <ref type="theTimes">the Chicago
                    Times</ref>, beginning with <date when="1888-07-30">July 30,
                    1888</date>, and there read the articles, under the heading <ref type="newspaperSeries">“City Slave Girls,”</ref>
                which should make the nom de plume of the writer, <ref type="nellNelson">“Nell Nelson,”</ref>
                forever dear to all toiling womankind</ref>: </p>
       
   
        
            <p><date when="1888-07-10">Tuesday, July 10</date>, according to instructions, I made up
                for the role of shop-girl, and with a list of factories in one hand, and gentle
                peace in the other, sailed <desc type="location">down town</desc> under a brown baize veil as impenetrable as an
                iron mask.</p>
            <p> I did not realize the <desc type="workingClass">ignominious position of respectable poverty</desc> till I reached a
                    <ref type="company">cloak factory</ref> on <desc type="location">Madison street</desc>, where <desc type="workingClass">labor is bondage, the laborer a slave, and flesh and blood
                    cheaper than needles and thread</desc>. Corporations are said to be without
                heart, but this concern is a commercial inquisition. It puts its help on the plane
                of slavery, and nothing but civil law prevents the use of the lash. </p>
            <p> The factory is on the third floor of a large brick building. Elevator? No, indeed. An elevator is a luxury, and
                    luxuries have no place here. You will be short of breath when you reach
                the top of the fourth flight, but in recovering you have time to take in the <pb n="18"/> surroundings—a great barn of a place,
                    with the single charm of good light. There is plenty of vacant room, but the
                    women are huddled together, elbows touching, along the line of machines.
                Into the west windows pours the odor of <placeName>Chicago</placeName>’s
                    famous sewer river; at the south end of the
                    room, not ten feet from the crowded table, is a tier of closets, and on hot days
                    the combined odor of the two is shocking. <desc type="workingClass">Nobody
                    dare complain about smells, cold, heat, work, wages or rules. But whoever
                    heard of martyrs complaining?</desc></p>
            <p> My experience began at 7:50 a.m. and lasted just three hours. When I climbed the
                dusty stairs I took a ten-minute rest at the top. Everybody was at work but
                    a hungry-looking man about twenty-seven years old, with skin the color
                    of a Russia turnip, and thin, peaked features. He was dressed in a pair of
                    heelless slippers, a white shirt, and a pair of shop pants that some poor slave
                    had received eighteen cents for making. Neither collar, vest, coat, nor
                    suspenders burdened his emaciated form. He moved among the workers with
                a cat-like tread, his shoulders drooping and his knees opening and shutting with a
                sort of accordion movement at every step. He passed me several times as I stood at
                the desk, and eyed me so unpleasantly that I
                turned my back to him.</p>
            <p>After waiting at the desk for three-quarters of an hour, I asked the clerk, a
                    sweet little girl of sixteen years, with pretty red cheeks and dark eyelashes
                    and hair, for work, and was told to wait till the forelady came round.
                A dozen girls were waiting, too, some with <ref type="factoryItem">cloaks</ref>, others with check-books and
                tickets, and a few with <ref type="factoryItem">hand-made fringe</ref>. The fringe girl I spoke
                to. She told me <desc type="wageDesc">she received <num type="wage" value=".05">5 cents</num>
                    a yard for making an imitation of seal-ball fringe, such as winter cloaks are
                    trimmed with</desc>. <desc type="workingClass">She had a piece three yards and a
                    quarter long that had taken her all the previous day to make. Here was a child
                    of fifteen working nine and a half hours a day for a competence of <num type="wage" value=".1625">16 1/4
                    cents</num></desc>. Will the <desc type="location">Prairie Avenue</desc> woman who, at the suggestion of
                    <persName>Mrs. Ormison Chant</persName>, is trying to find a hundred girls who
                are earning less than <num type="wage" value=".28">28 cents</num> a
                    day, please enter <persName>Maggie W----</persName> on the list, and will
                the women of the <orgName>Protective Agency</orgName> who want a new field of
                inquiry, call and see the slim, snake-gaited, jaundice-faced creature who
                    has charge of this human mill?</p>
            <p><persName>Maggie</persName>’s <ref type="factoryItem">fringe</ref> being measured and her book checked, she was
                given another box of material, and went off to weave it into <ref type="factoryItem">tassel-trimming</ref>. The
                girl who took her place would not be interviewed. She "didn’t know how much
                stitchers earned, and wouldn’t tell nobody how much a week she could make." She was,
                possibly, twenty-five years old, with a <desc type="workingClass">deathly pale face,
                    and looked as though she hadn’t eaten any breakfast</desc>. <pb n="19"/> Her
                successor was less reticent. "I'm here since
                        <date when="--05">May</date>, but I don’t like it. The boss is a horrid
                        thing. Him and the forelady watches us all the time, and they don’t give us hardly any work. I can only make one cloak
                            a day; <desc type="wageDesc">some pays <num type="wage" value=".30">30
                        cents</num>, some <num type="wage" value=".40">40 cents</num>, and some <num type="wage" value=".50">50 cents</num>. Yesterday I had <num type="wage" value=".60">60
                        cents</num> coming to me for two days</desc>. Are you long here? Oh, you won’t
                    stay. <desc type="upperClass">They search your bag and your pockets when you
                        go home nights to see if you have any thread or pieces about
                    you</desc>."
            </p>
            <p> After waiting an hour <ref type="nellNelson">the disguised investigator</ref> was properly enrolled among the
                toilers of this particular cloak factory, assigned to a place in the work-room, and
                given a good-sized bundle of material, which was to be made into a garment. </p>
            <p>"This is a <num type="wage" value=".65">65-cent</num> <ref type="factoryItem">cloak</ref>," said the
                    hard-featured spinster who acted as forelady. "The <ref type="occupation">stitcher</ref>
                    gets <num type="wage" value=".20">20 cents</num>, the
                        <ref type="occupation">binder</ref>
                    <num type="wage" value=".15">15 cents</num>, and you get <num type="wage" value=".30">30 cents</num> for finishing, if the work is
                    right." Here was, indeed, a fortune! <num type="wage" value=".30">Thirty cents</num> for making a long cloth cloak after the seams were stitched. <desc type="womensLabor">It had to be trimmed down the back gores, around the
                    collar, cuffs and pockets with mohair plush; the sleeves had to go in— eighteen
                    button-holes to be worked and a corresponding number of buttons sewed on, and
                    the seams and edges faced with black muslin</desc>. <num type="wage" value=".30">Thirty cents</num>, in other
                    words, for a good day’s work of ten hours!
