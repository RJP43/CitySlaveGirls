            In the making <pb n="14"/> of each of these articles the reader will perceive that the
            demand has brought about the supply. <desc of="womensLabor">There was need in each case for the manual
            dexterity, the light and careful touch and the patient and tireless application which we
            recognize as the chief advantages of women’s work.</desc> For this peculiar ability, however,
            it is unfortnnately true that the women are the <workingConditions category="wageDesc">worst paid
                laborers</workingConditions> in <placeName type="country">America</placeName>. They receive <workingConditions category="wageDesc">shamefully low wages</workingConditions>, and <workingConditions category="negative">the conditions under which
            they work are disgraceful to our boasted civilization</workingConditions>. For instance, <!-- RJP: could make this into a table titled the average wages of women employees in first-class establishments-->
            <occupation>braid-makers</occupation> average <num type="wage" amount="5.50">$5.50</num> a week;
            <occupation>vest-makers</occupation>, <num type="wage" amount="6.00">$6.00</num>;
            <occupation>button-hole makers</occupation>, <num type="wage" amount="4.30">$4.30</num>;
            <occupation>candy- makers</occupation>, <num type="wage" amount="4.75">$4.75</num>;
            <occupation>cap-makers</occupation>, <num type="wage" amount="5.50"
                >$5.50</num>;<occupation>tobacco-strippers</occupation>, <num type="wage" amount="5.50"
                    >$5.50</num>; <occupation>cigar-makers</occupation>, <num type="wage" amount="5.00">$5.00</num>;
            <occupation>dressmakers</occupation>, <num type="wage" amount="5.00">$5.00</num>;
            <occupation>hatters</occupation>, <num type="wage" amount="6.00">$6.00</num>; <occupation>ladies’
                hat makers</occupation>, <num type="wage" amount="4.00">$4.00</num>;<occupation>paper-
                    makers</occupation>, <num type="wage" amount="5.00">$5.00</num>;
            <occupation>rag-sorters</occupation>, <num type="wage" amount="3.50">$3.50</num>;
            <occupation>shirt-makers</occupation>, <num type="wage" amount="6.00">$6.00</num>. 
            These figures, however, come from first-class
            establishments, which are not afraid to expose their methods of working to the light of
            day; establishments which, unfortunately, are in a helpless minority among the employers
            of female labor. The writer believes, from a careful study of all the facts to which he
            could get access, that the <workingConditions category="wageDesc">average wage for female skilled labor in
                this country, throughout, is somewhere between <num type="wage" amount="4.50">$4.50</num> and <num type="wage" amount="5.00">$5.00</num> a
        week, and the average time worked is something
            more than ten hours a day</workingConditions>. The reason is plain: <desc of="womensLabor">female labor is not organized,
            it is perfectly helpless, and the weakest, under the beneficent and kindly law of
            nature, goes to the wall.</desc> </p>
        <p> There are classes of work done by women whose conditions can not in justice be
            criticised as can the so-called skilled labor, and which are, if not too well paid, at
            least comfortable, healthy, and proper; chief among these is <statistic info="specific">domestic
                service, in which, in <date year="1888">1888</date>, more than 1,200,000
                females are employed.</statistic> <workingConditions category="wageDesc">Their wages run between <num
                    type="wage" amount="10.00">$10</num> and <num type="wage" amount="14.00">$14</num> a month some, of course, ranging
                as high as <num type="wage" amount="25.00">$25</num> and <num type="wage" amount="30.00">$30</num>, and few falling below
                    <num type="wage" amount="10.00">$10</num>, so that <num type="wage" amount="12.00">$12</num> is a conservative general
                average. To this is of course to be added board and lodging and perquisites, easily
                worth <num type="wage" amount="20.00">$20</num> a month more</workingConditions>. The <occupation>domestic
                servant</occupation> is, as a rule, <livingConditions category="positive">well fed</livingConditions>,
            <livingConditions category="positive">cleanly and comfortably lodged</livingConditions>, and <workingConditions
                category="positive">fairly treated</workingConditions>; but <desc of="womensLabor">the idea of household work is so
            repugnant to many women that they prefer the starvation wages of the trades and the
            unwholesome crowding of the tenements</desc>. <industry>Laundresses and hotel
                servants</industry> have also <workingConditions category="comparison">surroundings and lives better for than anything to be
            found in the factories</workingConditions>, but here, too, <desc of="womensLabor">the objection of “menial service” applies, and
            most <nationality nation="America">American-born</nationality> women will have none of
            it.</desc></p>
        <p> Up to within the past few years there was practically no recourse for an educated woman
            who had her own living to make save teaching. This 
            <pb n="15"/>
            list has also been extended, and <occupation>type-writing</occupation>, which pays about <num type="wage" amount="10.00">$10</num> a week, <occupation>stenography</occupation> at an
                average of <num type="wage" amount="12.00">$12</num>, and different kinds of
                <occupation>clerical work in stores, keeping books, cash, etc., and selling
                goods</occupation>, which are paid for at the rate of from <num
                    type="wage" amount="5.50">$5.50</num> to <num type="wage" amount="10.00">$10</num>, and sometimes <num type="wage"
                    amount="15.00">$15</num> a week, have been added to the list. <statistic info="vague">So that on the whole there
            are now in <placeName type="country">America</placeName> about one hundred separate callings bidding
            for female labor, out of which the woman who must win her bread may take her choice.</statistic>
            That the theater for her endeavor has thus been widened is by itself a good thing. <desc of="womensLabor">The
            chance for self-help, the possibility of independence, lifts the sex up, and as the
            years come on we can expect to see the sphere of woman’s action broadening until it at
            last will include all of these industries, where tactual skill, delicate manipulation,
            and careful work are needed rather than strength.</desc> But before we congratulate ourselves
            too much upon the high civilization which this indicates, let, us look at the reverse of
            the picture.</p>
        <p>It is a fact that <desc of="womensLabor">female labor the world over is in a most pitiable condition; women are
            weak in every way, weak individually and weak in their lack of organization, and there
            are men ready at all times to take advantage of their weakness</desc>. In
                <placeName type="city">London</placeName> <workingConditions category="wageDesc">the average wage of the whole body of women workers
            is, according to official figures, less than <num type="wage" amount="7">seven shillings</num> (<num type="wage" amount="1.75">$1.75</num>) a week, and out of this sum the worker must find food for herself, rags to cover her, and a
                    place to stay when she is not struggling for these few paltry bits of silver</workingConditions>.
            As to the effect, hear what <person>the English factory inspector</person> says as late
            as the <date when="1888-07-01">1st of July, 1888</date>: </p>
        <p>
            <quote speaker="factoryInspector">“Domestic workshops, as now extended, are a great evil.
                Instead of large factories and legally constituted
                    workshops we have thousands of domestic
                    workshops, <workingConditions category="negative">dark, 
                        dirty and overcrowded</workingConditions>, and which <desc of="womensLabor">can not be improved by factory legislation, for at the time of the passing of the act the present state of things could not have been
                contemplated. Let not keen competition bear the whole of the blame, but rather let
                the truth be spoken, to the credit of greediness, and an unconcern for the welfare of unskilled operatives</desc>. Our
                   <desc of="workingClass">female population are losing self-respect, for they
                have no hope of improvement, being unskilled operatives</desc>; <desc of="workingClass"

                    of="workingClass">they frequent places where drink is supplied</desc>, and
                    <desc of="workingClass">where utterances are set to music provocative,
                    enticing and subtle, a luxurious yet sensuous gratification of untrained
                    minds</desc>, <desc of="workingClass">unrestrained when their small earnings
                    are paid</desc>; but in the end they are most assuredly the victims of the
                    <italics>voluptas empta dolore</italics>.”</quote>
        </p>
        <p> And in the factories the conditions are such that the most callous <pb n="16"/> reader
            must stand appalled at the details. In 424 factories where women were employed in
            <location type="general">the east end of <placeName type="city">London</placeName></location>, <workingConditions category="negative">sewer gas
                was present in dangerous quantities</workingConditions>, and <workingConditions category="negative">the
                sexes were huddled together without any attempt at decency</workingConditions>. <workingConditions category="negative">The places are described as foul and filthy.</workingConditions> <statistic info="specific">Among 600
                lost women who answered the questions put to them by the inspector, 511 had been
                factory operatives</statistic>. The only wonder is that the proportion is not
            greater.</p>
        <p> But we are accustomed to look on <placeName type="city">London</placeName> as a place in another
            world. How is it at home? Here is the condition in <placeName type="city">New York</placeName>

            <p> The factory is on the third floor of a large brick building. <workingConditions

            <p> My experience began at 7:50 a.m. and lasted just three hours. When I climbed the
                dusty stairs I took a ten-minute rest at the top. Everybody was at work but

                    of a Russia turnip, and thin, peaked features. He was dressed in a pair of
                    heelless slippers, a white shirt, and a pair of shop pants that some poor slave
                    had received eighteen cents for making. Neither collar, vest, coat, nor
                    suspenders burdened his emaciated form. He moved among the workers with
                a cat-like tread, his shoulders drooping and his knees opening and shutting with a
                sort of accordion movement at every step</person>. <workingConditions category="negative">He passed me several times as I stood at
                the desk, and eyed me so unpleasantly that I
