    <articleBody><date when="1888-07-10">Tuesday, July 10</date>, according to instructions from <ref to="theTimes">THE
            TIMES</ref>, I made up for the role of shop-girl, and with a
        list of factories in one hand and gentle peace in the other sailed down <location type="streetName">State
            street</location> under a brown braise veil as impenetrable as an iron mask. I applied
        at two <industry>feather factories</industry> and three <industry>corset shops</industry>, but aside from the exercise up and down
        several flights of stairs got nothing. The feather people did not need any help and the
        corset folks had not started on the winter trade. <workingConditions category="positive">I was treated with civility, however, and
        given permission to “drop in a week or so.”</workingConditions> The fifth place on my list was the
            <company name="identified">“Western Lace Manufacturing Co.”</company> <location type="address">218 State street</location>. Ascending one
        flight of stairs I stopped to take off my veil and adjust my eyes to the low light. That
        done I looked about and finding a door marked ”Office of the <company name="identified">Western Lace
            Manufacturing Co.</company>” with “Come In” on the glass I complied. A <person who="workingGirl" gender="female">young girl</person>
        followed and leaving her to close the door I fell into a chair, the only one about, and
        proceeded to perspire and scrutinize the place. <workingConditions category="positive">The
            office was not uninviting. The flow had a cheap carpet, the ceiling was high and the
            room well ventilated and admirable lighted.</workingConditions> On a long table, that
        served as a sort of fortification for the private office of the company, were the
        samples—“antique crocheted good”—as they are listed, in various shades of white. All were of
        different pattern and unvarying ugliness. There were round tidies and oblong tidies, square
        mats for a bureau and smaller ones of oval and circular design, intended for a lamp or
        cushion. Behind the table, sachetiny between a writing stand and a desk, was <person gender="male">a young man of
        30 or so, of blonde type, with a stationary scowl between his eyebrows and <unclear/>
        otherwise pleasing manner. That is, I thought the manner pleasing till I began to get
        acquainted with it and then my opinion changed.</person> After a lapse of five minutes or so the
        <person gender="male">fair-haired gentlemen</person> turned to the <person who="workingGirl" gender="female">young girl</person> with a deepening of the <unclear/> and a most
        unalluring <mascVoice>“Well?”</mascVoice>.<unclear/> <femVoice>“I brought the mate back.”</femVoice> <mascVoice connotation="negative">“Oh, you have, eh?”</mascVoice> opening a piece
        of newspaper and unfolding a dozen hand-made mats the size of a tea-plate. <workingConditions category="negative">The work is
        carefully examined on both sides and as he proceeds the scowl deepens. Without a word he
        tosses the lot on the little table and reaches for the proffered black the girl had opened.</workingConditions>
        <mascVoice>“What’s your name?”</mascVoice> <femVoice>“<persName>Rhafferty</persName>.”</femVoice> <mascVoice>“How do you spell it?”</mascVoice>
        <femVoice>“R-h-a-f-f-e-r-t-y.”</femVoice> <mascVoice>“Oh, yes; <persName>Martha Rhafferty</persName>,”</mascVoice> after hunting through
        a long list. <mascVoice>“Do you want more work?”</mascVoice> <femVoice>“No, sir.”</femVoice> <mascVoice>“There’s plenty more if you want it.”</mascVoice> <femVoice>“No;
        my mother don’t want me to do any more <occupation>crocheting</occupation>.</femVoice> <mascVoice>“Well, <persName>Mr. White</persName>
        isn’t in now. Can’t you come in again?”</mascVoice> No answer. A look of discouragement comes over the
        young face. <mascVoice>“Don’t you have to do any shopping about town?”</mascVoice> <femVoice>“No, sir.”</femVoice> <mascVoice>“Well, you can wait,
        can’t you? Wait here. Take a chair. (I had the only one.) Just go in the next room there and
        take a chair.</mascVoice> As he went to lead the way <person who="forePerson">the crochet-teacher</person> called his attention, and the
        girl remaining I seized my chances for a bit of interviewing. <persName>Martha</persName> showed me her contract,
        in which <workingConditions category="wageDesc">the firm agreed to refund $1 of the $3 deposited when she had finished $15 worth of
        work</workingConditions>. On the back of the contract were the credit receipts of the company entered in lead
        pencil, dating from <date month="--01">January</date> to <date month="--07">July</date>. She told me she lived in <placeName type="general">Gross Park</placeName>, away out on the
        <location type="general">West side</location> that <desc of="workingClass">she helped her mother, and had been trying to earn <num type="wage" amount="15.00">$15</num> since <date month="--01">January</date></desc>. She
        received <workingConditions category="wageDesc"><num type="wage" amount=".60">60 cents</num> a dozen for the mats and it took her a week to crochet a dozen</workingConditions>. <femVoice connotation="negative">“Then I

        as a security. I began in <date month="--01">January</date>, the first week, and now I am through. <workingConditions category="wageDesc">I have made <num type="wage" amount="15.00">$15</num>,

           <mascVoice who="boy"> “<persName>Mrs. Clark</persName> sent these mats and she, wants you to receipt for

        her—her—are you a relation?”</mascVoice> <mascVoice who="boy">“Yes.”</mascVoice> <mascVoice who="forePerson" connotation="negative">“Well, you must tell her to wash her hands. These goods

       <nellVoice> “Oh, I can crochet.”</nellVoice> <mascVoice>“This kind of work?”</mascVoice> handing over one of the <num type="cost" amount=".60">60-cent</num> mats. <nellVoice>“Yes; what

              As he caught the seraphic expression some facial machinery gave a lurch that threw on side
        of his countenance bias for a second. Reaching to the desk he pulled out the following
        circular and handed it to me. <company name="identified">OFFICE OF WESTERN LACE MANUFACTURING CO.
                (Incorporated)</company>, <location type="address">218 STATE STREET, CHICAGO,
            ILL</location>—<unclear/>: In reply to your letter regarding the work we send

            for?”</nellVoice> I ask. <mascVoice connotation="negative">“Can’t you read? The <num type="cost" amount="2.00">$2</num> is to pay for the samples and instruction and the <num type="cost" amount="1.00">$1</num> as
        a security for our material. I don’t know who you are and if I gave you the thread I might
        never see you again.” “I don’t need instruction. I can make the stitch and I don’t want to
        put any such amount in samples.</mascVoice> <nellVoice>If you can’t trust me with a spool of thread and a pattern
        will you sell me the material?”</nellVoice> <mascVoice>“That’s not the way we do business. If you want to work for
            us you will have to comply with the contract. You pay <num type="cost" amount="3.00">$3</num>; that entitles you to a sample mat
            which we teach you how to make. After you have <num type="wage" amount="15.00">$15</num> made worth of work we refund the <num type="cost" amount="1.00">$1</num>.”</mascVoice>
       <nellVoice> “What about the other $2?”</nellVoice> <mascVoice>“It goes to us for instruction and samples.”</mascVoice> <nellVoice>“Will I have to make
        the samples?”</nellVoice> <mascVoice>“Yes.”</mascVoice> <nellVoice>Then there are thirteen in the <company name="identified">Western Lace Manufacturing

        set.”</mascVoice> <nellVoice>“But I don’t want any. I have a supply. Tell me how much will you sell me a thirteenth

        for sale?”</nellVoice> The scowl becomes threatening, but I venture to ask how much thread it takes to
        mat for a closer calculation of the profits. No answer is deigned. <nellVoice>“If I give you $3 you
        will give me work?”</nellVoice> <mascVoice>“Yes,”</mascVoice> in a sullen tone. <nellVoice>“How much?”</nellVoice> <mascVoice>“All you can do,”</mascVoice> brightening up a
        little. <nellVoice>“How do I know you will give me back $1 after I’ve earned $15?” I ask. “I don’t know
        anything about you. I never heard of your firm before and there is no name on this paper.”</nellVoice>
        <mascVoice>“I guess your motives are bad. You don’t want work.”</mascVoice> <nellVoice>“What guarantee have you to offer of
        honesty or respectability?”</nellVoice> With glaring eyes, distended nostrils, and face crimson with
        rage he threw down a pile of <num type="cost" amount=".02">2-cent</num> blank books in front of me. <mascVoice connotation="angry">“There’s our customers:
        every state in the union is represented; go to them if you want references. Here are more

        <nellVoice>‘I see you have a minimum local trade. Chicago women don’t seem overzealous about the
        crocheting business.”</nellVoice> Then I asked him where he got a market for the goods and the name of
        some business man to whom I could go for reference. <mascVoice>“Now I am not going to do any more
        talking with you about this business.”</mascVoice> <nellVoice>“Why?? Is it a secret organization, a sort of

        right and I won’t answer any more questions until I know who you are and what you want.”</mascVoice>
        Poor <persName>Mr. Ford</persName> was so furious by this time that I thanked him for his
        attention and bade him good afternoon. At the foot of the stairs I waited to tie my veil on
        and see how <persName>Martha</persName> fared, but at the expiration of thirty minutes she
        was still waiting for <persName>Mr. White</persName> and her <unclear/>.

        apply at the factory <location type="address">133 West Washington street</location>. “Work is given out at
        7:30 a. m.,” the clerk informed me, “and if you have any snap about you you can make a good
        living. By the way of getting the required snap I went home, ate my dinner, and was in bed
        at 8 o’ clock. <desc of="workingClass">The next morning I resumed the rags of poverty and at 7 o’clock made my debut
        as the factory hand.</desc> <workingConditions category="workDesc">I was one of 120 women, ranging in age from 15 to
            60</workingConditions>. The factory where the <factoryItem>never-rip jerseys</factoryItem> are made is
        at the <location type="streetName">corner of Washington and Union streets</location>, with the elevator
        entrance in the rear and workroom in the fifth story. The girls began to arrive at 7
        o’clock, and at every trip of the elevator some twenty or more were carried up-stairs. I
        took a chair in one of the machine rows, and for an hour did nothing but watch the
        preparations for work in that <workingConditions category="comparison">human hive</workingConditions>. <workingConditions category="negative">The room was
        50x138, with an open unfinished roof and brick walls calcimined</workingConditions>. Light was admitted from
        rear and side windows. <workingConditions category="workDesc">The pressmen had their boards and furnaces at the south end of the
        room, where all the work was pressed prior to being boxed and ticketed for the trade. At the
        extreme opposite end was the cutting-room, fenced in from the rest, and between the two were
        the worktables, where the hundred odd girls stitched and finished the <factoryItem>jerseys</factoryItem>.</workingConditions>
        Along the brick walls were nails, irregularly driven, on which the girls hung their hats and
        wraps, dresses and collars. Nearly every one took off her dress and waisit, turned it inside
        out, put it on a nail and put on a calico of old stuff shop suit. A few took off their
        corsets and nearly all the machine hands changed their shoes before work. On the stroke of
        7:30 a bell rang, the power was turned on <workingConditions category="comparison">the machines began to buzz like little saw-mills
        and the day’s work had commenced</workingConditions>. <workingConditions category="negative">Heads of brown, black, yellow, and gray bent so near the
        flying shuttles that every minute I experted the bangs and fluffy crimps would get caught in
        the machinery. </workingConditions> <nellVoice connotation="pity">The faces were sad and so very, very pales that I
                shall never look at a <factoryItem>jersey</factoryItem> again without seeing
                them.</nellVoice>
        <workingConditions category="workDesc">The average age may have been 23, but not less.</workingConditions>
        <workingConditions category="negative">There were girls of 17 and 18 and some world-weary women past 50 all
            working for little more than enough to keep body and soul together.</workingConditions>
        The work circulated in baskets—long chip hampers with stout-handles—that held a dozen, with
        room for five times that quantity. <workingConditions category="workDesc">A great deal of time was lost by the
            workers in getting the contents of the basket examined, checked off on the ticket and
            the ticket stamped.</workingConditions>
        <desc of="workingClass">If it had been the last change for life I don’t believe the girls would have worked
            any harder for salvation. Scarcely a head was raised from machine or lap.</desc>
        <nellVoice connotation="pity"><workingConditions category="negative">Shoulders were bent down, chests hollowed in, and
                faces drooped so low that I could not begin to make a study of the “windows of the
                souls” before me.</workingConditions></nellVoice> At 8:40 the proprietor of the
        chair I was in asked me to vacate, and I walked down through the narrow aisles of
            <occupation>sewing-women</occupation> to the “<person who="forePerson" gender="female">forelady</person>” and asked for work.
        She asked me if I wanted to take a machine, but I expressed a preference for finishing. I
        was given a numbers, a basket with five <factoryItem>jerseys</factoryItem> to finish, and a chair beside a
        girl named <persName>Hannah</persName>, who, being engaged by the way was told to “show me.”
            <persName>Hannah</persName> had blonde hair and talked with the brogue. <workingConditions category="workDesc">She gave me a
        needle as long as my engagement finger, and the most meager instruction compatible with
        obedience. Fortunately I had my thimble and crossing my knees I threaded the
           gimlet-like needle with silk and I proceeded to
            hook-and-eye a <factoryItem>jersey</factoryItem>.</workingConditions> Remembering the treachery of
        my shop clothes I ever wore filled the two hooks and eyes with sewing and after testing them
        proceeded to face the collar. <desc of="workingClass">I told <persName>Hannah</persName> about my misery, but she
            wisely said it was no fault of hers and went on with a <workingConditions category="wageDesc"><num type="wage" amount="3.00">$3</num>-a-dozen lot she had been doing two
        days and a half</workingConditions>.</desc> <workingConditions category="camaraderie">Thinking it would be a good way to get acquainted with my neighbors I asked
        several for a fine needle and at last exchanged the crow-bar <persName>Hannah</persName> had
        given me for a line cambric article. It worked better</workingConditions> and at the end of two
        hours I had bound the arm-holes,
           faced the collar,
            tacked the front facing and the bustle
        piece, and put two patts of hooks and eyes in a black <factoryItem>jersey</factoryItem>. <workingConditions category="negative">The
            dye was not fast, neither was the wool, for my throat, ears,
            and nostrils were tufted with black lint. I was African from the nails to the wrists.</workingConditions> The
        front facings had to be trimmed off. I had no scissors. <persName>Hannah</persName> was
        dangerous with her, and <workingConditions category="wageDesc">I lost about <num type="cost" amount=".15">15 cents</num> worth of time borrowing the weapons.</workingConditions>
               <workingConditions category="negative">At noon I had finished four <factoryItem>jerseys</factoryItem> and was
                so sore about the neck and back that I could scarcely rise from the
                chair.</workingConditions> <workingConditions category="camaraderie">I began to scent hot tea, and looking about saw
        a big girl called <persName>Emma</persName> brewing three pots of <placeName type="country">Japan</placeName> over one of the
        press furnaces. She had her front hair in curl papers and was whistling “In The Sweet Bye
        and Bye.” About thirty girls went to her, each with her own cup, for a supply of tea. I
        remarked to one passing my chair that her tea looked awfully nice and asked where she got
        it. “From <persName>Em</persName>. She makes it and we each pay <num type="cost" amount=".02">2 cents</num> a week.”</workingConditions> <workingConditions category="negative">On the
        stroke of 12 the machine stopped and 120 tired women stopped too, for thirty minutes’ rest
        and the food that could hardly be called refreshing. In the main it consisted of brown bread
        and butter. In some parcels there was cold meat and cake: others had pie; a few a bottle or
        canteen of milk, cold tea or coffee, but I did not see a particle of fruit.</workingConditions> <desc of="workingClass">One little girl
        who had been stretching <factoryItem>jerseys</factoryItem> at <num type="wage" amount=".02">2 cents</num> each made a lunch on three graham
        crackers and a piece of custard pie, which she ate reading a paper-covered book. I counted
        thirty-seven girls with a lunch of dry bread, fifteen with sandwiches, and ten who ate cold
        pancakes. Twenty-three girls were without any luncheon whatever.</desc> During the intermission the
        elevator stopped running and no one left the building but myself. Less than ten minutes was
        spent over the wretched mea. <workingConditions category="negative">At one side of the west wall, separated by a
            ten-foot pine partition, was the toilet-room containing an iron zinc with one faucet of
            running water.</workingConditions>
        <workingConditions category="comparison">Here the girls crowded like so many cattle</workingConditions>, each with her
        bit of soap and grimy cotton towel, to wash. Dress waists were loosened and necks, faces,
        arms, and hands lathered with soap and rinsed, as the change permitted. <workingConditions category="negative">There were three
        closets, unflushed, untidy, and unwholesome. Set up against the wall in this enclosure, with
        the faucet run through the partition, was a barrel of ice water inscribed in big letters:
          “Two cents will be collected every Saturday for ice
          water.”</workingConditions> <workingConditions category="negative">Besides this luxury every hand pays <num type="cost" amount=".12">12 cents</num> a week for the
        use of the machine.</workingConditions> At 1 o’clock I finished my basket, which I dragged to
            <persName>Tom</persName>, the book-keeper, who took my name and credited me with five
        garments. <workingConditions category="wageDesc">No price had been put on the <factoryItem>jerseys</factoryItem>, as they were sampled goods, but
        the forelady thought they would go at <num type="wage" amount=".60">60 cents</num> a dozen, which meant <num type="wage" amount=".25">25 cents</num> to my credit.</workingConditions> I
        didn’t get any more work till 2 o’clock because <desc of="middleClass">the <person who="forePerson" gender="female">forelady</person> was in the
        toilet-room having her bangs done up in paper. She was a pretty woman, by the way, with a
        good face and a shock of beautiful auburn hair. She had been in her position for six years
        and was drawing a salary of <num type="wage" amount="35.00">$35</num> a week. The girls had a good word for her generally, but she
        struck me as being a woman without heart.</desc> At her appearance I was given a basketful of
            <factoryItem>jerseys</factoryItem> to finish button-holes. <workingConditions category="comparison">I
            worked like a Trojan for an hour</workingConditions>, at the end of which I won the heart
        of a <person who="workingGirl" gender="female">little girl</person> who sat at the end of my table facing the wall. She had been sitting still
        so long that I called out and asked if she were ill. <femVoice connotation="negative">“No. I haven’t any work.”</femVoice>
                    <workingConditions category="negative">Tired almost to exhaustion and as
                    hot as a newly-built mustard plaster I was only too glad of a chance to transfer
                    my interests, but she declined.</workingConditions>
        It was too hot to work; she was going away soon, she said, and didn’t care to do any more.
        <femVoice connotation="woe">“When did I begin? Today. I worked in a <industry>box-factory</industry>, but it was so dull I could only earn <num type="wage" amount=".16">16

        he was “steady as a steeple, and the only fellow she ever loved.”</femVoice> <workingConditions category="camaraderie">I told her how to go about
        catching the prosperous telegrapher and rehashed a recipe given me by no less a personage
        than <persName>Mrs. John M. Sherwood</persName>, which I had never tried. She was going to a
        picnic at <placeName type="general">Garfield park</placeName> at 6 o’clock and brought over a <num type="cost" amount=".25">25-cent</num>
        chocolate cake to show me. Then she loaned me her scissors, told me good-by, and went home
        to dress for the fete.</workingConditions> <desc of="workingClass">Nothing of any importance occurred till someone passed the news that
        a girl was asleep in the closet. Half a dozen left their machines to look at her,
            <persName>Hannah</persName>, my mentor, among them. “Oh, you just ought to see her, fast
        asleep, with her mouth wide open.” It was more than I could stand.</desc> I threw my
            button-holes into the basket and went to the toiletroom.
            <desc of="workingClass"> Sure enough, there was the <person who="workingGirl" gender="female">poor girl</person> sitting in the dirty place, her
            head resting against a folded apron, breathing in the foul air that reeked with filth
            and disease. The walls of the closet were black with pencil marks,
        the floor was strewn with lint and threads, and the pale face of the sleeper looked ghastly
        in the darkness. She had tied one end of a string to the latch and the other to the drop
        chain.</desc> <nellVoice connotation="pity">“My dear child, musnt’t sleep here. Are you sick?”</nellVoice> <femVoice>“Oh, I am so sick.”</femVoice>
            <workingConditions category="camaraderie">Instantly there were a dozen willing hands to help her out to a window
            where a chair was placed for her. We rubbed her temples, chafed her hands, bathed her
            head, and got her some lemons.</workingConditions> After making her toilet she came over to my
        table as I sewed away at my button-holes she told me her story.
           <femVoice connotation="woe"> “<persName>Rose</persName> and I are only six months in this country. We came from
            <placeName type="country">England</placeName> with our brother and live on <location type="streetName">Carpenter

        it was so clean. We had a <person who="forePerson" gender="male">foreman</person> over us and he was as good as a brother to us. Sometimes
        we let our money lay and drew it in a pile; oh, such a lot as it was! We put away very much
        of it.</workingConditions> But I got sick and all we ‘ad saved went for doctor and medicine. Then the work
        stopped. They took our names though and promised to send for us in the fall. For a while we

        She didn’t think it would be honored so I took it to the cashier myself and demanded pay as

        nickel to have my corner swept, and finding it impossible to wash up sans towel and soap I
        got under my veil and rang the elevator. The pressers laughed and told me to try the
        stairs—five flights. Down I went. At the second I went into the salesroom to buy a

        and 12:30 p. m. Anyone five minutes late working on time is fined an hour’s pay, and for the
        loss of an hour the pay of half a day is knocked off. Piece-workers who are late are kept
