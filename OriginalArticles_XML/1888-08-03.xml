<articleBody>Two weeks ago <persName>Rev. Mr. Gross</persName> preached a sermon relative to the morals and progress of the working woman. Among other things he referred to a “good Jew” who, having the comfort of the hundred odd girls in his <company name="unidentified">cloak factory</company> at heart, “provided every day for <desc of="workingClass"><num type="cost" amount=".01">1 cent</num> a substantial lunch</desc>.” I sent the reverend gentleman a note, inclosing a stamp for the address of the “good <nationality nation="undefined">Jew</nationality>” and in reply came the name of <persName>H. Zimmerman</persName>, <location type="address">233 Monroe street</location>. On went <desc of="workingClass">poverty’s respectable rags</desc>, and off I posted for shop-work and a penny spread. 
    The elevator carried me to the top of the building where every week thousands of <factoryItem>jackets</factoryItem>, <factoryItem>sacques</factoryItem>, <factoryItem>circulars</factoryItem>, <factoryItem>dolmans</factoryItem>, and <factoryItem>cloaks</factoryItem> are turned out to supply the country trade of the northwest. Here in a <workingConditions category="negative">crowded room, with low ceiling and dingy walls, poorly ventilated and insufficiently lighted</workingConditions>, <workingConditions category="negative">sit between eighty and 150 young girls surrounded from Monday morning until Saturday noon by the ceaseless clatter of the sewing-machines in an atmosphere so thick that it can be cut with a knife</workingConditions>.  <workingConditions category="negative">The machines are run by steam, and notwithstanding the great buckram fans overhead that revolve with a crackling noise the ceiling is so low</workingConditions> and the <workingConditions category="negative">air so hot as to be positively stifling to the initiated</workingConditions>. There is the <workingConditions category="negative">smell of dye from brown, blue, and black cloaks coupled with the still more offensive odor from the “English plaids”</workingConditions>; <workingConditions category="workDesc">along the pressing-table are the gas stoves where irons are heated and where the girls sponge and press collars and seams, each operation attended with a little cloud of steam and a stuffy, scorching smell that blows about and around the whizzing fans</workingConditions>; <workingConditions category="negative">clouds of lint from the textures in hand covers everything it constantly being inhaled by the sewers</workingConditions>. Then, too, there is the<workingConditions category="negative"> smell of rancid machine oil</workingConditions>; the <workingConditions category="negative">overpowering exhalations from so many perspiring and unkempt persons and an occasional whiff from the six or seven toilets closets</workingConditions>, all powerful facts of one might smell that must be smelled to be appreciated. <workingConditions category="negative">The <person who="employer" gender="male">“good Jew”</person> had all the windows open, but the place was so strong I almost fainted</workingConditions>. 
    I have a seat in the middle of the room and a <num type="cost" amount=".35">35 cent</num> <factoryItem>Norfolk</factoryItem> to make. <workingConditions category="negative">It is so dark that I can hardly see my stitches as I thread to sleeve hole with black muslin.</workingConditions>  The <person who="forePerson" gender="female">forewoman</person> can’t see either till she takes the work over to the window to examine it, and returns with a gratifying, <femVoice who="forePerson" connotation="positive">“Guess that it will do.”</femVoice>
<workingConditions category="negative">We are so crowded along the line of tables that the girls are told to “take short threads,”</workingConditions> and <workingConditions category="negative">I duck my head every time the <desc of="workingClass">pale-faced, hollow-eyed girl</desc> at my left pulls her needle out, to escape being hit</workingConditions>. She has only been able to make three <num type="cost" amount=".50">50 cent</num> <factoryItem>long cloaks</factoryItem> in five days and says:
<dialogue><femVoice who="workingGirl" connotation="intimidated">“You won’t mind my taking long threads; will you, if I don’t hit you?”</femVoice>
<nellVoice connotation="positive"><workingConditions category="camaraderie">I tell her to pull away and offer to fell the bottom hem on her cloak to which she agrees.</workingConditions></nellVoice></dialogue> <desc of="workingClass">She has on a cheap jersey waist, a calico skirt, and the little but of underwear that shows at her neck where she has opened her collar is as black almost as her jersey. Her shoes are broken and one of the uppers is mended with black thread. She lives with her folks and has “a lot of little brothers and sisters, but the ‘Q’ strikes have put them all out” so that she hasn’t bought anything for herself this year except a hat at the Fair.</desc>
<dialogue><nellVoice connotation="prayer">“Do you go to church?”</nellVoice> I ask. 
<femVoice who="workingGirl">“What’d I go to church for?”</femVoice> <!--Not sure what connotation should go with the above and below nellVoice. Could this be prayer simply because she is talkign about church? Or is descriptionnNeutral good enough?-->
<nellVoice connotation="prayer">“For the music and the sermon.”</nellVoice>
<femVoice who="workingGirl">“I want a seat, though, and <desc of="workingClass">I’d rather ride down to the shop and back than pay <num type="price" amount=".10">10 cents</num> to get in the pew</desc>.”</femVoice>
<nellVoice connotation="pity">A poor little creature, bony and grimy, and wild-eyed as the “marchioness” goes down on her hands and knees and turns out the dust in the cracks of the floor with the eye of her needle.</nellVoice> 
<femVoice>“I’m huntin’ for pins,”</femVoice> she says, <femVoice>“to fix on the braid.”</femVoice>
<nellVoice connotation="descriptionNeutral">“Doesn’t <persName>Zimmerman</persName> provide you with pins?”</nellVoice>
<femVoice who="workingGirl" connotation="negative">“Indeed he doesn’t; nor with nothin’ else but fannin’ and what’s the good of fans in an oven?”</femVoice></dialogue>
The child turns up the pins some of them bent, and puts them first in her mouth to straighten them and then in the bosom of her dress <femVoice who="workingGirl" connotation="prayer">humming to herself, “Rock of Ages.”</femVoice> At the expiration of the hunt a new difficulty befalls her. The needle’s eye is stuffed as she says and in an effort to remove the filling off goes the head optic and all. <workingConditions category="camaraderie">Nobody has another to lend and I give her mine.</workingConditions> She says she is <persName>Pat</persName> and the daughter of a <location type="streetName">Twelfth street</location> teamster. Her mother is living and <livingConditions category="descriptionNeutral">she and her brother <femVoice who="workingGirl">“help the family along.”</femVoice></livingConditions>
    <femVoice who="workingGirl" connotation="negative">“Yes, I went to school and learned numbers and geography, but I can’t sew very well. <workingConditions category="wageDesc">The <person who="forePerson" gender="female">forelady</person> says that’s why I don’t make more. I got <num type="wage" amount="2.75">$2.75</num> one week, but I don’t know how much I’ll earn this week. I used to be in the Fair and they gave me <num type="wage" amount="2">$2</num> runnin’—checks</workingConditions> I didn’t like it there, because I never got home till 8 at night and the boys was guyin’ us all the time.”</femVoice>
    At noon time <workingConditions category="negative">the girls crowded into the wash-room and those unable to reach the already wrining-wet towel that hung near the sink dried on their dresses.</workingConditions> I saw a tall young <nationality nation="Germany">German</nationality> woman wash her arms and neck and shake off the water as well as she could with the palms of her hands before putting on her dress waist again. Another, a girl of 14, who wore a plaid skirt and an old velvet jacket, dried her hands on her underclothing. <workingConditions category="negative">The lunch the <person who="employer" gender="male">“good Jew”</person> served consisted of a cup of black coffee that was neither nutritious nor fragrant, and minus cream and sugar, for which the girls paid <num type="cost" amount=".2">2 cents</num> a cup. Then there were cuts of pie at <num type="cost" amount=".5">5 cents</num>each, which delicacy, architecturally speaking, had two stories, substantially built, with a water-proof inner lining of fruit mucilage. The top crust had bubbled up in the baking till it was a warty as tripe, and tenacity of the under dough would have sufficed for hinging a cellar door.</workingConditions> <nellVoice connotation="sarcasmWit">This is certainly not the lunch <persName>Rev. Mr. Gross</persName> referred to in his sermon, but it’s the only one the girls in the <company name="identified"><persName>Zimmerman</persName> factory</company> knew anything about. </nellVoice>
<nellVoice connotation="offended">However profitable the menu may have been to the firm it was anguish to many of the hungry toilers unable to procure it.</nellVoice> <desc of="workingClass">We girls who had no money to invest in the appetizing (?) viands sat by, begging with our eyes and following with melting mouths every morsel on its way down the throats of our neighbors.</desc> <desc of="workingClass">One of us, a mite of a girl, wan-faced and hectic, who had been watching the mastication of a well-fed machine-hand, waited till the leathery strangle of peach-paste had almost disappeared and then asked to consumer to <femVoice who="workingGirl" connotation="woe">“give her the crust.”</femVoice></desc>
When the well-fed party said “naw” the child called her a “dirty beggar” and laid her little head on her arm for a nap. <workingConditions category="wageDesc">I went out to buy a needle and some day when it rains and the wind is never weary I shall send in a bill for the <num type="wage" amount=".20">20 cents</num> <persName>H. Zimmerman</persName> owes me on a cotton-back Norfolk.</workingConditions> <workingConditions category="negative">Only a half hour was allowed for the noon rest during which the girls washed and combed, trimmed their finger-nails with scissors, and talked, or went to sleep.</workingConditions> 
<workingConditions category="negative">All hands were on deck at 7:30 in the morning, in which manner and the 5:30 hour of closing the Saturday half-hour was made good to the firm.</workingConditions> Many of the girls told me they made ten <factoryItem>cloaks</factoryItem> a week which averaged <num type="cost" amount=".30">30 cents</num> apiece. <workingConditions category="positive">Work was good, the season covering 10 months of the year.</workingConditions> <workingConditions category="negative">A number of men at work on the <factoryItem>long cloaks</factoryItem> had chairs at the side of the girls and knew well enough personally I did not polish them for they were saturated with tobacco fumes and smelled a foul, sweaty, sickening odor. </workingConditions>
