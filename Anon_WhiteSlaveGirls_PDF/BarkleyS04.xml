A CLOAK CONCERN WHERE NOTHING BUT FEAR OF THE LAW SEEMS TO PREVENT THE USE OF THE LASH.
EIGHTY CENTS A WEEK FOR LABORING FROM 7:30 IN THE MORNING UNTIL 5:30 IN THE EVENING.
I did not realize the ignominious position of respectable pov-
erty till I went to E's cloak factory, where labor is bondage,
the laboror a slave, and flesh and blood cheaper than needles
and thread. Corporations are said to be without heart, but
this concern is a commercial inquisition. It puts its help on
the plane of slavery, and nothing but civil law prevents the use
of the lash.
The factory is on the third floor of the large brick building
at the east end of Madison street bridge on the south side of
the street.
Elevator? Not much.
An elevator is a luxury, and luxuries have no place at E's.
You will be short of breath when you reach the top of the
fourth flight, but in recovering you have time to take in the
surroundings - a great barn of a place with a single charm of
good light. There is plenty of vacant room, but the women
are huddled together, elbows touching along the line of
machines. Beneath the west windows flows the river; at the
south end of the room, not ten feet from the crowded table, is
a tier of closets, and on hot days the combined odor of the two
is shocking. Nobody in his employ dare complain about
smells, cold, heat, work, wages or rules. But whoever heard
of martyrs complaining?

My experience began at 7:50 A.M. and lasted just three
hours. When I climbed the dusty stairs I took a ten-minute
rest at the top. Everybody was at work but a hungry-looking
man about 27 years old, with skin the color of a Russia turnip
and thin, peaked features. He was dressed in a pair of heel-
less slippers, a white shirt, and a pair of shop pants that a
clothing store pays 18 cents for making. Neither collar, vest,
coat nor suspenders burdened his emaciated form. He moved
among the workers with a cat-like tread, his shoulders drooping and his knees opening and shutting with a sort of accordion movement at every step. He passed me several times as I stood at the desk and eyed me so unpleasantly that I turned my back to him.
After waiting at the desk for three-quarters of an hour, I
asked the clerk, a sweet little girl of 16 years, with pretty red
cheeks and dark eyelashes and hair, for work, and was told to
wait till the-forelady came round. A dozen girls were waiting
too, some with cloaks, others with check-books and tickets, and
a few with hand-made fringe. The fringe-girl I spoke to. She
told me she received 5 cents a yard for making an imitation of
seal-ball fringe, such as winter cloaks are trimmed with. She
had a piece three yards and a quarter long that had taken her
all the previous day to make. Here was a child of 15 working
nine and a half hours a day for a competence of 16 1/4 cents.
Will the Prairie avenue woman, who, at the suggestion of Mrs.
Ormison Chant, is trying to find one hundred girls who are
earning less than 28 cents a day please enter "Maggie W--- on
the list, and will the women of the P--- agency who want a
new field of inquiry, call and see this slim, snake-gaited,
jaundice-faced creature who has charge of this human mill.
Maggie's fringe being measured and her book checked, she
was given another box of material and went off to weave it
into tassel-trimming. The girl who took her place would not
be interviewed. She didn't know how much stitchers earned
<pb n="23"/>
and wouldn't tell how much a week she could make." She
was, possibly, 25 years old, with a deathly pale face, and
looked as if she hadn't eaten any breakfast. Her successor
was less reticent. "I'm here since May, but I don't like it;
the boss is a horrid thing. Him and the forelady watches us
all the time, and they don't give us hardly any work. I can
only make one cloak a day; some pays 30 cents, some 40 cents,
and some 50. Yesterday I had only 60 cents coming to me
for two days. Are you long here? Oh, you won't stay. They
search your bag and your pocket when you go home nights to
see if you have any thread or pieces about you."
Before I had a chance to talk w'ith another unfortunate the
little rosy-cheeked clerk told me "it's against the rules for new
hands to stand here. You must go over by the stairs and wait
till the forelady comes." I smiled at the pretty child and she
rewarded me by bringing a chair to me a few minutes later.
All means of cummunication<!-- RJP:10/20/15:retained spelling --> being cut off I amused myself making sketches of the shirted, slippered, sleuth-like creature as he passed.
This pastime was interrupted by the appearance of a fat
woman. She had on a black sateen suit that fitted her puffy
figure like the raiment of a well boiled suet pudding. She
carried herself like a drum major on a dress parade and by
way of ornaments wore a gold watch with a double coil of gold
chain at her belt, gold earrings, a gold breast pin, gold cuff-
buttons and two gold rings. Bigger than bust or bustle was
the woman's head I discovered when I asked :
"Are you the forewoman?"
"Forelady, yes. What do you want?"
"Work."
"What can you do ?"
"Sew."
"Wherehave you been working?"
"N. R. Co."
<pb n="24"/>
"Want to stitch?"
"No, I would rather finish."
"Give your name to the clerk."
I complied and was entered on his book as the resident of a
vacant lot on Monroe street. The forewoman selected a bundle
as big as a Kamschatka baby from a mountain of bundles and
said:
"Here, go over there and wait till I come." 
"How much do you pay for this class of work?"
"I don't know. It seems to me you're mighty particular."
"If you don't know who does?" I asked.
"You make me dizzy," she said, dropping the bundle and
giving me a look of intense disgust. She took a small book
from her pocket containing the price-list and asked me what
number.
"I don't know."
"Look."
"Where?"
"You'll come down a peg or two before long," and with a
groan she bent over the bundle at her feet, flushed apoplectically and said "360." Referring again to her price-list: 
"Them's sixty-five cents," and left me.
I raised that sixty-five cent ulster, and with my arms folded
about the fuzzy, ill-smelling thing, moved "down there" as
directed, and halted at the edge of a huge rag box. Here I
stood for twenty minutes, when the forewoman came aft and
bade me "this way." I pursued. There was a halt about
the middle of the shop and I seized it for a "scoop."
"How many girls have you here?"
"Never counted them."
"What can experienced cloak hands earn in a day?"
"Never asked them."
"How much of your salary is for politeness?"
"You can sit here," pointing to a cane chair with half the
<pb n="25"/>
seat gone. "That girl with the black dress will do your
stitching; the one at the end of the second table will bind the
seams, and Annie down there in brown calico - she's fixing
the machine now - will give you any help," and she was off.
"I beg your pardon, did I understand you to say I would
get sixty-five cents for making this cloak?" following her.
"Now your're just a little bit too fresh. If you don't want
the work, say so."
"I do want the work but I want to know what it will pay
first."
"This is a sixty-five cent cloak. Do you get that through
your head? The stitcher gets twenty cents, the binder gets
fifteen cents, and you get thirty cents for finishing if the work
is right. If it isn't, you get out."
I thanked her and was alone. Here I thought lay my
fortune. Thirty cents for making a long cloth cloak, after the
seams were stitched. It had to be trimed down the back gores
around the collar, cuffs, and pockets with mohair plush. The
sleeves had to go in, eighteen buttons sewed on, eighteen holes
worked, and all the seams and edges faced with black muslin.
Thirty cents! To save my life I couldn't have finished the
garment in ten hours. I was just reaching that conclusion
when the forewoman appeared with a small book, two checks,
and a piece of tailor's chalk as big as a dime.
"Your number is 180; chalk it on all these pieces and if you
lose any you will be fined."
"How much?"
"How much? You cheeky thing! The cost of the cloth
and the cutter's time. That's how much. Give this check to
the binder and that one to the stitcher."
"Will you please tell me how this side gore goes?"
"Go to Annie. I ain't here to learn you how to sew."
"May I have a needle?"
"Furnish your own needles."
<pb n="26"/> 
"May I have basting cotton?"
"There aint any. You have to wait till it gets here." 
I gave a girl a penny for a needle and stole some thread from an absentee's stock. Then I waited fifteen minutes while the finder got through and basted up the seams for the stitcher. That much done I got to work on the plush. The forewoman passed by and told me I "was not showing enough fur. Go over to the sample and look at the work." 
She sneered when I asked her where the samples were, but a neighbor volunteered the information. There was no sample on the rack and I stepped over to inform the forewoman, who curtly told me it was none of her affair. 
"Will you please tell me how wide to make this trimming?" 
"Go to Annie." 
Poor Annie was doctoring a machine and said "in a minute." On her way to me three stitchers implored her to look at their miserable implements and I waited patiently till I caught sight of the forewoman looking at her bangs in a handglass. Apologizing for the intrusion I asked her if the sample had come yet.
"No."
"I wish you would kindly show me how wide to make this trimming."
"Go to Annie, I told you." 
"Annie is too busy. She's mending machines." 
"Well, I won't be bothered with you." 
"What's the reason you won't?" 
"Cause I won't" 
"Well you will. Tell me how wide you want this plush or I will see Mr A---" 
"See him. I don't care. There he is," pointing to a snaky, half-starved creature whose shanks I had been sketching and on whom I had scornfully turned my back. It was too much to ask of a free-born American woman to recognize the superi-
<pb n="27"/> 
ority of such a person. He came up to us in an instant. The forewoman was livid with rage and she began to talk as fast as her tongue could move. Some fifty or more girls heard the tirade breathlessly. Before the half-dressed proprietor had a chance to get over his astonishment I threw the front of the cloak at his face, the side body at the forewoman, and walked off to my disabled chair with Mr. A. for a bodyguard. He was the color of a sanitarium babe when we reached my work table. He had the two pieces of cloak in his hand, and when he raised his fist to strike me I worked up an Indian-club attitude and dared him.
He escorted me to the toilet-room, where I went for my hat and jacket, and before slamming the door in his face by way of a hint as to the privacy of the place I threw my needle and thread at him. Mr. A. saw me across the shop and down the first flight of stairs. And there ended my first experience in a cloak factory.
