^ The labor of learning something, and of making that ac-
quired knowledge public, concerning the real life led by the
^ working girls of a great city, was accomplished in the regular
t routine of newspaper duty, and at the request of the editor of
i the Chicago Times. The duty was performed, however, with
•^1 a feeling of interest and a sense of responsibility greater than
- ; ordinarily follows obedience to a newspaper assignment. There
was an earnest endeavor, excited by a day’s experience and
'-7— subsequently increased to give all absolute facts with all their
£ bearings and to portray with exceptional fidelity and guarded-
CO ness the state of things as existing. It is possible that in the
^ wording of some sentence, in the turning of some phrase, in-
justice has been done to some employers—though through no
misstatement of facts. If so, it has been impulsive and unin-
q) tentional and must be so accepted and understood. I tried
-(j simply to tell of what I saw.
The appearance of these articles in book form was neither
o	my idea nor within my design when writing them. With the
request to write this brief introduction comes my first know-
ledge of the undertaking.	Nell Nelson.
