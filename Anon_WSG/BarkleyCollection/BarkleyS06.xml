<head><list><item>EATING POOR CRACKERS AND WORKING FOR TWO MONTHS IN ORDER TO GET A PAIR OF SHOES.</item></list></head>
<p>One of the chance acquaintances I made at the jersey factory worked three days for J--- S---- &amp; C, Market street,
receiving 65 cents for her labors about ten days after leaving.
One-third of 65 cents is 21 2/3 cents.
That is the way S---- &amp; Co. solve the problem; but the
question is one that capital, Christianity, and civilization are
invited to analyze.
"Don't never go to S----'s," the little girl said, "it's an awful
place."
On Saturday I tumbled out of bed at 6 A.M. and donned
my factory clothes. On the way down-town the street-car met
with an eight-minute obstruction in the shape of a load of
bricks, and when I reached the manufacturing establishment of
J--- S---- &amp; C it was 8:32 o'clock. The elevator took me
up one story and I was told to "get out." I told the boy at
the rope that I wished to go up to the work room.
"You're too late," he said. "Have to take the freight ele-
vator down at the back of the store."
Down I walked as directed past long tables, that towered
with long cloaks, dolmans, ulsters, jackets, and short wraps;
past two or three busy unobserving clerks, past a pair of forbidding-gooking men who glared at me from under their black
hats and blacker brows; past an earthen-gray-stringy crash
towel that waved at half-mast over a dirty wash-basin, past a
tier of closets that emitted a stifling odor, and on down to the
packing-room. I waited for a big lusty packer to finish pummelling the mischievous little Swede who ran the elevator and
<pb n="32"/>
was carried up to the top floor with a box of cloth. When the
car landed I found myself at the extreme end of a room 50x80
feet, in an enclosure of wire-fence, packing-boxes, and cutting-
boards - beyond and between which I could see perhaps two
hundred persons, mostly women, bent over machines, and
working as only slaves ever work. The thundering noise made
by the machinery deadened every other sound, even that made
by the cutters as they ran their heavy shears through the satin
and muslin trimmings. Sixteen persons passed me - men in
undershirts, trousers and slippers, with work in their hands;
men in business suits with work in their brains; girls of 13 in
rags and death-like pallor, with work in their arms; older and
paler girls and still older and paler women, some with white
hair and spectacles, carrying work to be pressed, examined,
altered or checked. Nobody noticing me, I asked a pretty
little girl who was cutting a bolt of satin into cuff-lining to
direct me to the forewoman and was told to go and sit down
till she came. I had hardly arranged myself on an empty box
when a playful young man capsized my throne and spilled
me in a heap of unmade cloaks. My first impulse was for revenge, but remembering that I was a poor girl looking for work
I contented myself by petting my damaged left knee and right
elbow. While mentally photographing the miserable, little,
bullet-headed sapling who caused my trouble, a young woman
brought me a chair and placed it in a corner, which convenient
spot happened to be off a narrow passage leading to the work-
room proper. My nose was not long in seeing a row of closets
that walled the south side of the passageway. Overhead was
a pasteboard sign with "No admission to the work-room"
printed in large, black letters. There was no place beyond
where I could sit or stand without being in the way unless
I went back into the freight elevator, so I resolved to stick it
out.
For almost two hours I sat in the dark, filthly place with a
<pb n="33"/>
handkerchief over my mouth and nose waiting for the fore-
woman to come and admit me to the shop. I watched the poor
girls pass and repass, their broken shoes slipping up and down
with every step, and their ragged skirts often catching new
gaps from the nails of the packing boxes. Just as I was 
beginning to get myself in a state of passivity, as prescribed by
Mrs. Eddy, and was combatting the foul smell of the closets
with the wholesome healthy atmosphere of South Park, something in my head seemed to give way, and the whole factory
turned into a colossal whirligig. The big goose of the presser
and the little irons of the press girls began to play tag, and
machines, operators, finishers, wire-forms, cutters, examiners,
messengers, models, forewomen, teachers and firm, all joined
in the merry go round. To escape being knocked in the head
by a two-story press-board I clutched a little stitcher who said:
"You an't sick, is you?"
I guessed I was. Bringing me a tin cup full of water, she
departed saying: "She'd be docked if she didn't go."
An old man with grey hair and glasses showed me to the
freight elevator and I was let down to the second story. When
I reached the staircase I sat down on the top step to recover.
A portly man with a straw hat, full beard, broad shoulders,
and a suit of mixed goods, mistaking me for a tramp, came
out from the stock and informed me that "no peddlers are
allowed on the premises. Move off."
I moved off determined to return another day.
