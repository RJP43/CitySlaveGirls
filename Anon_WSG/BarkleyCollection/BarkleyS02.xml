                    <p>At R--- &amp; Co’s and R--- Bros. I applied for work and was told to report
                        in the morning to sew on cloaks.</p>
                    <p>The manager in S’s on Market street wanted hands and offered to engage me at
                        once. I was most impudently catechised, some seven inquiries requiring as
                        many false statements. What was my name, place of residence, last position,
                        amount of wages received, state of my health, nativity, married or <pb
                            n="13"/> single - to which I answered "neither." Here was a dilemma.</p>
                    <p>"Oh, yes, widow? " and an inordinate ha! ha!</p>
                    <p>"Yes."</p>
                    <p>"Grass widow, eh?" with a sneer.</p>
                    <p>"How much do you pay for cloaks", I asked, tired of the ordeal.</p>
                    <p>"Fifty c«nts each."</p>
                    <p>It was enough and I left the creature still anxious to solve the widow
                        question.</p>
                    <p>By the time I reached L’s on Market street, I was in a reckless frame of
                        mind.</p>
                    <p>"Is there any work for a good sewer?" I asked the girl in the office.</p>
                    <p>"Yes, plenty. John give her some pants."</p>
                    <p>John had eyes the color of calico, and a complexion like an immature tomato.
                        He led the way to the cottonades, which were cut, trimmed, and tied up in
                        bundles of a dozen garments each.</p>
                    <p>"Here’s a sample," holding up a pair of overalls of brown cottonade. "The
                        work is cut out, but you will have to do everything yourself. I want you to
                        make the fly extra strong and press the bottoms. We pay 75 cents a dozen and
                        you find your own thread."</p>
                    <p>"Seventy-five cents for a dozen of these pants and find my own thread?"</p>
                    <p>"Yes, or I’ll give you 80 cents a dozen and give you linen thread if you sew
                        the buttons on fast."</p>
                    <p>"No, I guess, I won’t take the pants. What other work have you?"</p>
                    <p>"Here are cheviot shirts, if you'd rather. Gusset the tail here and the
                        sleeves, stay the bosom and arm-holes, and make the collar and wristbands
                        extra strong. These pay 75 cents a dozen." He offered to give me three on
                        trial. The thread cost 5 cents, car-fare 10 cents, and I should have left 3
                        cents after the job.</p>
                    <pb n="14"/>
                    <p>John said: "That’s so, but I can’t help it. If the work is satisfactory you
                        can have a six-dozen lot."</p>
                    <p>It was very good for John to sympathize with me, but I thanked him and said I
                        would look a little further.</p>
