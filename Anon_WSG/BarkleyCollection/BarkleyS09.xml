                    <p>Two weeks ago Rev. Mr. Goss preached a sermon relative to
                        the morals and progress of the working woman. Among other
                        things he referred to "a good Jew" who, having the comfort
                        of the hundred odd girls in his cloak factory at heart, "pro-
                        vided every day for 1 cent a substantial lunch." I sent the
                        reverend gentleman a note, inclosing a stamp for the address
                        <pb n="52"/>
                        of the "good Jew," and in reply came the name of H. R---,
                        Monroe street. On went poverty's respectable rags, and off I
                        posted for shop-work and a penny spread.
                        The elevator carried me to the top of the building, where
                        every week thousands of jackets, sacques, circulars, dolmans,
                        and cloaks are turned out to supply the country trade of the
                        northwest. Here in a crowded room, with low ceiling and
                        dingy walls, poorly ventilated and insufficiently lighted, sit
                        between eighty and 150 young girls, surrounded from Monday
                        morning until Saturday noon by the ceaseless clatter of the
                        sewing-machines in an atmosphere so thick that it can be cut
                        with a knife. The machines are run by steam, and notwithstanding the great buckram fans overhead that revolve with a
                        crackling noise, the ceiling is so low and the air so hot as to
                        be positively stifling to the uninitiated. There is the smell of
                        dye from brown, blue and black cloaks coupled with the still 
                        more offensive odor from "English plaids;" along the pressing-
                        table are the gas-stoves where irons are heated and where the
                        girls sponge and press collars and seams, each operation attended by a little cloud of steam and stuffy, scorching smell
                        that blows about and around the whizzing fans; clouds of lint
                        from the textures in hand covers everything, and is constantly being inhaled by the sewers. Then, too, there is the
                        smell of rancid machine oil; the overpowering exhalations from
                        so many perspiring and unkempt persons and an occasional
                        whiff from the six or seven toilet closets, all powerful factors of
                        one mighty smell that must be smelled to be appreciated. The
                        "good Jew" had all the windows open, but the place was so
                        foul I almost fainted.
                        I have a seat in the middle of the room, and a thirty-five
                        cent Norfolk to make. It is so dark that I can hardly see my
                        stitches as I bind the sleeve hole with black muslin. The fore-
                        woman can't see either till she takes the work over to a window
                        to examine it, and returns with a gratifying "Guess that'11 do."
                        <pb n="53"/>
                        We are so crowded along the line of tables that the girls are
                        told to take short threads, and I duck my head every time the
                        pale-faced, hollow-eyed girl at my left pulls her needle out, to
                        escape being hit. She has only been able to make three fifty-
                        cent long cloaks in five days and says:
                        "You won't mind my taking long threads, will you, if I
                        don't hit you?"
                        I tell her to pull away and offer to fell the bottom hem of
                        her cloak, to which she agrees. She has on a cheap jersey
                        waist, a calico skirt, and the little bit of underwear that shows
                        at her neck where she has opened her collar is as black almost
                        as her jersey. Her shoes are broken and one of the uppers is
                        mended with black thread. She lives with her folks and has
                        "a lot of little brothers and sisters, but the 'Q' strikes have
                        put them all out" so she hasn't bought anything for herself
                        this year except a hat at the Fair.
                        "Do you go to church?" I ask.
                        "What'd I go to church for?"
                        "For the music and the sermon."
                        "I want a seat, though, and I'd rather ride down to the
                        shop and back than pay ten cents to get in a pew.
                        A poor little bony and grimy, and wild-eyed as the "marchioness," goes down on her knees and turns out the dust in the
                        cracks of the floor with the eye of her needle.
                        "I'm huntin' for pins," she says, "to fix on the braid."
                        "Doesn't Zimmerman provide you with pins?"
                        "Indeed he doesn't; nor with nothin' else but fannin' and
                        what's the good of fans in an oven?"
                        The child turns up the pins, some of them bent, and puts
                        them first in her mouth to straighten them and then in the
                        bosom of her dress, humming to herself "Rock of Ages, Cleft
                        for Me." At the expiration of the hunt a new difficulty befalls
                        her. The needle's eye is stuffed, as she says, and in the effort
                        <pb n="54"/>
                        to remove the filling off goes the head, optic and all. Nobody
                        has another to lend and I give her mine. 
                        She says she is thirteen and the daughter of a Twelfth street
                        teamster. Her mother is living, and she and her brother
                        "help the family along."
                        "Yes I went to school and learned numbers and gogerfy,
                        but I can't sew very well. The forelady says that's why I
                        don't make more. I got $2.75 one week, but I don't know
                        how much I'll earn this week. I used to be in the Fair and
                        they gave me two dollars runnin' checks. I didn't like it
                        there because I never got home till eight at night and the boys
                        was guyin' us all the time."
                        At noon-time the girls crowded into the wash-room and
                        those unable to reach the already wringing-wet towel that
                        hung near the sink dried on their dresses. I saw a tall young
                        German woman wash her arms and neck and shake off the
                        water as well as she could with the palms of her hands before
                        putting on her dress waist again. Another, a girl of fourteen,
                        who wore a plaid skirt and an old velvet jacket, dried her
                        hands on her underclothing. The lunch the "good Jew"
                        served consisted of a cup of black coffee that was neither
                        nutritious nor fragrant, and minus cream and sugar, for which
                        the girls paid two cents a cup. Then there were cuts of pie at
                        five cents each, which delicacy, architecturally speaking, had
                        two stories, substantially built, with a water-proof inner lining
                        of fruit mucilage. The top crust had bubbled up in the baking till it was as warty as tripe, and the tenacity of the under
                        dough would have sufficed for hinging a cellar door. This is
                        certainly not the lunch Rev. Mr. G. described, but it is the
                        only one the girls in the Z. factory know anything about.
                        However profitable the menu may have been to the firm it
                        was anguish to many of the hungry' toilers unable to procure it.
                        We girls who had no money to invest in appetizing (?)<!-- RJP:10/21/15: this is in text DON'T REMOVE --> viands
                        sat by begging with our eyes and following with melting
                        <pb n="55"/>
                        mouths every morsel on its way down the throats of our neighbors. One of us, a mite of a girl, wan-faced and hectic, who
                        had been watching the mastication of a well-fed machine hand,
                        waited till the leathery tangle of peach-paste had almost, disappeared and then asked the consumer to "give her the crust."
                        When the well-fed party said "naw," the child called her a
                        "dirty beggar," and laid her little head on her arm for a nap.
                        I went out to buy a needle, and some day when "it rains and
                        the wind is never weary" I shall send in a bill for the seven
                        and one-half cents H. Z. owes me on a cotton-back Norfolk.
                        Only a half-hour was allowed for the noon rest, during which
                        the girls washed and combed, trimmed their finger-nails with
                        scissors, talked, or went to sleep.
                        All hands were on deck at 7:30 in the morning, in which
                        manner and the 5:30 hour of closing, the Saturday half-hour
                        was made good to the firm. Many of the girls told me they
                        made ten cloaks a week which averaged fifty cents apiece.
                        Work was good, the season covering ten months of the year.
                        A number of men at work on the long cloaks had chairs at the
                        side of the girls, and while well enough personally I did not
                        relish them, for they were saturated with tobacco fumes and
                        emitted a sour, sweaty, sickening ordor.</p><!-- each paragraph represented in the text will get its own <p> element -->
