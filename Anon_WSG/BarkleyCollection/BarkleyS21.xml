<head><list><item>CEASELESSLY, WEARILY UNCOMPLAININGLY WORKING AWAY WHILE THEIR EMPLOYERS AMASS MILLIONS.</item>
<item>SEVENTY-FIVE CENTS A DOZEN FOR MAKING OVERALLS IS PAID THE DRUDGES FOR THEIR HARD LABOR.</item></list></head>
<p>On the southwest corner of Washington boulevard and
Union street, towers a spacious brick building, on the third
floor of which H. W. K. &amp; Co. manufacture much of the clothing that supplies the country trade. The place is far from
uninviting. Clean halls and well-kept stairs proclaim the
faithful service of a janitor, and the girl who has worked in
<pb n="126"/>
"other shops" blesses the man at the rope every time she rides
in the neat mirror-lined elevator.
"H. W. K.," calls out the pilot. "First door to your
right. Open and ring." Entering I found myself in an iron
cage looking through the grating into the shop. I felt like a
felon waiting to be sentenced, but when I found the bell I gave
it three vigorous pulls and peered in at the workers. It was
the same show of bondwomen, with round shoulders, bowed
heads, red, brown, black, gold, and yellow hair, actually
brushing the machine arms, faces of that ghastly pallor peculiar
to down-trodden youth. Nearly all were clad and shod in the
rags of poverty. The machines were run by steam and the
rumble overhead and the whizz along the floor deadened all
other vibration. I counted eighty girls who bent over their
machines, working with an industry that was simply fierce.
Did you ever price a pair of overalls?
Well, they can't be bought in this town for less than 75
cents, the very price that H. W. K. &amp; Co. pay an experienced
operator for making a dozen pairs. The operator must be
experienced, for the firm don't want learners; they won't be
bothered with them. They have no time to teach. Anybody
who comes to their store is expected to buy, and anyone who
comes to their shop is expected to work and work well. It is
not that it takes time to teach a new girl how to press her
knee against the power wheel, how to hold the goods, and how
to thread the wind-running machine, but there is the wasted
cotton, the unnecessary handling of the jeans and cottonade
that takes the dressing off, and the skilled labor that would be
sure to come by and ask for the chair if the learner, the
wretched beginner, ambitious for more bread, was not in the
chair. This skilled labor can be relied upon for that excellence
of work and attention to detail that characterize custom work.
Your fashionable tailors may pay $3 for having a pair of
<pb n="127"/>
trousers made, but the stitching is not a whit better than Mr.
K. gets on cloth pants for $1.25 a dozen. The difference is
in the fabric, in the sewing silk, and the trimmings, but slip-
shod work is not accepted from the "sweaters." Let one of
them run crooked leg seam and the forewoman will fling
the garment back, command correction, promise dismissal if
the negligence is repeated, and you can depend upon her for
keeping her word.
I tell you, swell dressmakers and private family seamstresses
who get $3 a day and your dinner and supper, these young
girls who are slowly grinding out their lives for the wholesale
shops, the middle shop, and the slop-shop, would put you to
shame could the quality and quantity of their work and your
work be compared. Placed in one of these factories with a
machine in front of you and a dozen overalls at your feet at 75
cents a dozen, it would be more than four weeks before you
could earn that amount each day.
It is not enough to see that these girls can finish six, ten,
twelve, eighteen, or twenty-four of these pants in ten hours,
but to appreciate the work and calculate rightly the terrible
exhaustion, one must take the machine, take the garments and
take the experience for one's self.
While I waited in the little, wire-fenced vestibule for some
one to answer my ring I saw a girl of fifteen years or so faint
at her work and drop over on the machine table. Although
her comrades were on both sides no one looked to her condition
till their seams were finished. The girl on the left brushed the
matted hair up from the pale forehead, rubbed her white face
with her stained hand and advised her to go home.
Did she? No. She lay on her arms with her eyes closed
and the cool air from the open window fanning her face.
Across the way a building was being erected and fragments of
the material came in with the breeze, but her sensibilities were
<pb n="128"/>
not offended, and she slept at her silent shuttle and smiled as
she slept, as if in defiance of the dust and lime and thundering
noises of the mighty machinery of power and wealth.
The gate was opened by a man who referred me to the fore-
woman at the rear end of the shop. I walked back through a
perfect avenue of material. Fabrics on the left towered far
above the heads of the girls, bolts of uncut cloth, boxes of
trimming, and bundles of cut goods composing the wall. On
the right stretched work tables with newly-made flannel shirts,
laborers' overalls and shirts and woolen pants, rising tier upon
tier waiting to be ticketed and boxed and shipped north, west,
and south as far as the trade stretches. The forewoman was
not unpleasant and by no means unkind. She did not need
any help.
"Then why don't you take your sign down?  I asked.
"Well, I'll tell you. I have all the girls I can possibly accommodate. All the machines are taken, but all may not suit.
Some of the girls are not doing well, but I want to give them
a few days more and if I see they can't do the work I'll discharge them. Then I'll give you a chance, or any one who
calls."
"But they are working. See how they work! It's inhuman
to work women that way."
"You think so? Well, we won't talk about that now.
Yes, they are working, but they have to do a certain quantity
of work to be satisfactory."
"What do you call a certain quantity?"
"Well, enough to justify us in having them about. The
work is cut and has to be made to fill the orders of the house."
"What do you pay a dozen?"
	"I pay seventy-five cents for some kind and eighty-five cents
for better overalls; one dollar for others, and one dollar twenty-
five for wools."
"And the finishers?"
<pb n="129"/>
"Twenty-five cents a dozen. That is, to turn up the bottoms. All the other work is done by machine. It's not hard
work."
A good deal harder than I should care to engage in for my
daily bread.
Here, as elsewhere, the weekly stipend varies from a fair
competence to starvation wages. Plenty of hands earn three,
four, four and a half and five dollars a week, and a minimum
by slaivish industry and an experience beyond their years succeed in making seven, eight, nine, and ten dollars.
The factory is well managed, and H. W. K. &amp; Co. will get
full value of every penny paid the poor, pale, slight young
women. Be it said to the credit of these manufacturers their
factory is abundantly lighted and ventilated. The walls are
finished, the calcimine is white and pleasing, and the floors
are kept clean. There is a toilet-room near the center of the
shop—a big place, with three closets, a long sink, and not any
too much light. The plumbing is perfect, and the girls revel
in the luxury of three long towels a day. The towels, and
closets, though, are few enough for the convenience of a hundred girls.</p>
