<head><list><item>A YOUNG WIDOW ATTEMPTS TO SUPPORT HERSELF AND CHILD BY MAKING OVERALLS.</item>
<item>STARVATION STARING HER IN THE FACE, SHE SOLD HER HONOR RATHER THAN PART FROM HER BABY.</item></list></head>
<p>One of the white slaves of Chicago stood in the prisoner's
dock at the armory police court yesterday, moaning piteously.
She was young and her face was pretty. The big policeman
who stood at her side said he had arrested her for soliciting
men upon the street. She was booked as Kitty Kelly. The
frail, unfortunate girl brushed away her tears and told a story
that went straight to the heart of every man in the crowded
court-room. She was a white slave and might have worn
away her frail life sewing that her character should remain
pure and unsullied, but the grinning skeleton of starvation
haunted her by day and night, and in desperation she sold herself to the tempter. She w'as pale and thin and fierce hunger
had left marks upon her young face.
"Oh, judge, I never did such a thing before! I never did
it before! For God's sake have pity on me!" and she wrung
her hands in agony and sobbed convulsively.
"Nonsense," said the justice, trying to be stern. "You all
say that."
"My baby! my baby! Oh what will become of her? For
mercy's sake don't fine me! I have no money, not a cent.
Oh have mercy. I never was out before, surely I never was!"
The big justice looked inquiringly at the big officer and the
big officer with a touch of emotion in his voice, said:
<pb n="118"/>
"I never saw her before, your honor."
"Will you promise to keep off the street?"
"I can't, no I can't promise you that. God knows I would
if I could. But when I see my baby starving and there is no
other way to find food for her, what else can I do?" and the
wretched little woman sobbed as if her heart was breaking.
The justice looked stern.
"Oh sir," she sobbed, "if you only knew the misery and
sorrow, the despair and degradation to which I have been
humiliated, you might pity me. I was young when I
was married. For a while I was so happy. Then my
husband sickened and died. That was but little more
than a year ago. Soon after my baby was born. I had
no friends and no money. I was alone in this great city and
no one to help me or even to give me a bit of advice. Vainly
I sought for work. I could not go into service and take my
baby with me, and I could not bear the thought of parting
from it. At last I found employment in a factory. There I
made overalls and toiled from morning until night, week in
and week out. But work as hard as I could, I could only
earn four dollars a week. Baby took sick and I had to pay
for a doctor and medicine and it cost more than I could make."
Starvation or a life of shame, she said, were the only two
courses she could see, and for the baby's sake she chose shame.
But such a life was full of horror for her, and, disgusted and
ashamed, she went back to the old grinding toil. Striving
with all her power to earn an honest livelihood she again saw
that the struggle was too much, and two weeks ago she saw
that her baby must starve unless she found something else.
She went upon the street and was placed in the station. She
was moaning and sobbing, and though imprisonment seemed
probable, she only thought of her little girl.
"It was all because of my baby. She is my all and I can't
send her to the Home for the Friendless. I worked hard for
<pb n="119"/>
her but we could not live with only four dollars a week.
What could I do? I could not beg enough for both. Oh, I
was driven to it, and after I had sunk once, I could get nothing
else than the factory because I had no one who would give me
a letter of recommendation. It was starvation for my baby,
or shame."
"But many I know manage to live on less than four dollars
a week," said the magistrate.
"Yes, one person might; but I can't feed, clothe, and shelter my baby and myself for that. Must I lose my baby
because a woman cannot earn more than enough in Chicago
to give herself black bread and a garret?"
She claimed that she was not on the downward path of her
own volition, and that if she could support herself and child
she would leave her life of shame. She was fined twenty-five
dollars, but execution was staid during good behavior. If
arrested again she will be given fifty days at the bridewell.
She left the court-room weeping and moaning.
"What will become of my baby," she cried, "if I am
brought here and have to be imprisoned for so long?"</p>
