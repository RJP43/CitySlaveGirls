<p>Chicago, Sept. 30, 1888.
The labor of learning something, and of making that acquired knowledge public, concerning the real life led by the working girls of a great city, was accomplished in the regular routine of newspaper duty, and at the request of the editor of the Chicago Times. The duty was performed, however, with a feeling of interest and a sense of responsibility greater than ordinarily follows obedience to a newspaper assignment. There was an earnest endeavor, excited by a day’s experience and subsequently increased to give all absolute facts with all their bearings and to portray with exceptional fidelity and guardedness the state of things as existing. It is possible that in the wording of some sentence, in the turning of some phrase, injustice has been done to some employers -- though through no misstatement of facts. If so, it has been impulsive and unintentional and must be so accepted and understood. I tried simply to tell of what I saw.
The appearance of these articles in book form was neither my idea nor within my design when writing them. With the request to write this brief introduction comes my first knowledge of the undertaking.
