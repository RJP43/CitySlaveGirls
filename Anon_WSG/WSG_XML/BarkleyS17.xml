                    <p>The birthright of an American girl may be a glorious attribute on the deck of
                        a transatlantic steamship or the floor of a London ball-room, but it is not
                        worth the flop of a brass farthing in the cloak factories of Chicago.</p>
                    <p>It was high noon by the Jesuit college clock When I got to the rear of --West
                        Twelfth street, where David K. has his shop. Nobody in but an old man. His
                        face is seamed with wrinkles. He has a big nose the color and texture of a
                        mushroom; his head and half his face is covered with hair of chinchilla
                        shades; his back is humped at the shoulders and his clothes are filthy and
                        worn. I ask for work and am told that no hands are needed. He has a pocket
                        that hangs across his waist and into which he puts rags, pieces of thread,
                        hooks and eyes, pins, buttons, and the empty spools that lie on the floor
                        about the vacant machine chairs. I watch the silent old man as he drags his
                        loose slippers across the floor, and behold I have the key to wealth! But it
                        doesn't profit me worth a copper. So I survey the premises.</p>
                    <p>One room, windows on three sides, and all shut. From the north windows I get
                        a view of a two-story hen-house. Filth inside and out. The outlook from the
                        east side is a picture of poverty, squalor and filth. The buildings have no
                        paint. In some are human beings, in others dumb brutes. Half-washed <pb
                            n="107"/> clothes dangle from window-sills and clothes-lines in tatters
                        and rags. In the yards are heaps of manure and the alleys are foul-smelling
                        and filthy. Along the street move flannel- shirted, horny-handed,
                        sooty-faced men, to smoke, to rest, to quarrel, and to dinner. Passing and
                        repassing all day long and every day—Sunday and Saturday—are young women and
                        old women, youths, maidens, and children, with as many cloaks or coats or
                        pants as they can carry. The garbage boxes are reeking with filth. Some one
                        had thrown ashes or sweepings in the box, and neither the swill man nor the
                        ash man will remove the contents. Mayor Roche and Dr. De Wolf, equally
                        ignorant of the manner in which their subordinates discharge their duty,
                        permit this sort of thing to go on till the very neighborhood is poluted and
                        the air poisoned by these reeking masses of corruption.</p>
                    <p>"Oh, it's nothing," I am told, and I see for myself and count from Karasick's
                        window and door eleven of these garbage piles that swarm with maggots and
                        flies. The sun beating down on the cheap pine box has made the wood shrink,
                        and from constant kicking and shaking amd probing of the miserable
                        rag-pickers who inhabit this locality the frame-work has been loosened and
                        the wood carried off for fuel, leaving on almost every block one or more
                        naked heaps of decaying matter.</p>
                    <p>Out of the south windows I look into the kitchen of some dozen wretched
                        families. The children are numerous and almost naked. They are unshod and
                        unclean, so very unclean that it is barely possible to tell their
                        complexion. The mother breaks a loaf in pieces in one house and throws it to
                        the little dirty faces on the doorstep. In another home the children eat
                        from a frying pan and next door all drink from the spout of the teapot. Down
                        in the yard is a pile of filth in which the children play and are followed
                        by a lot of chickens. The stable below stairs is locked, but stronger than
                        bolt or hinge is the <pb n="108"/> smell from within, and viler still is the
                        stench from the closets in and about the yard.</p>
                    <p>At 12:45 o'clock the hands began to arrive from lunch, first a young Pole,
                        then a Russian, then a German Jew. They wear woolen shirts and do the
                        machine work—do it beautifully, too, and their machines go like the wind.
                        The patriarch in skull cap and slippers goes round the shop looking at one
                        and the other, watching each operator to see that no extra waste of thread
                        is left at the end of the seams. Two more men and then a girl. She does
                        binding, nothing else, and gets $4 a week. At 1 o'clock six young girls are
                        sitting at a table in the northwest corner of the shop. They have been
                        running. They are hot, full of fun, and one throws the window up. Like a
                        volley from the enemy roll in the closet and stable smells and I move away
                        to escape it. The boss is three minutes late. He is a slight, meek man of
                        35, with a shirt the color of brown soap, dark trousers and a cheap coat. A
                        light beard covers his mouth and chin, and the expression in his eye has
                        that soft, quiet, gentle quality sometimes seen in cattle and sheep. I tell
                        him I want work.</p>
                    <p>"Machine?"</p>
                    <p>"No."</p>
                    <p>"Can you finish cloaks?"</p>
                    <p>"Yes."</p>
                    <p>"Where have you worked? "</p>
                    <p>"A dozen places. S's, E's, B's, Os, N's, S's, etc."</p>
                    <p>"Here finish this. I will see what you can do."</p>
                    <p>"How much?"</p>
                    <p>"Eight cents, and I pray, Father Abraham, forgive this thy son's
                        oppression."</p>
                    <p>I am given a chair at the table with the girls. Propped up on slender sticks
                        is a stout cord, on which is a lot of spoolthread—white and black, fine,
                        coarse and medium. Some more of the philosophy of Mr. K's old father-in-law.
                        The <pb n="109"/> thread is not wasted and the girls are not liable to carry
                        it off. I am given a big cotton and wool—principally cotton—ulster to
                        finish. I work like a lash-driven convict on the facings and collar and
                        cuffs till 4 o'clock, and am almost overcome by the air that floats up from
                        the yard below. It is done and I take it to the boss, who examines it for
                        fully five minutes.</p>
                    <p>"Too fine. Custom work. Don't need so good on such work. You stay?"</p>
                    <p>"How much a week?"</p>
                    <p>"Five dollars. You Christian?"</p>
                    <p>"Work Sunday?"</p>
                    <p>"Never!"</p>
                    <p>"Then I don't want you. Shop closed Saturday. Shop open Sunday."</p>
                    <p>"How much if I work five days?"</p>
                    <p>"No, you must work six days, like all."</p>
                    <p>"Not Sunday. Pay me, please."</p>
                    <p>I get out. Out past the stable-door, past the children in the manure pile,
                        past the ragged, yellow clothes on the line, past the back door, past swill
                        boxes, and the poor, pale-faced women carrying cloaks to and from
                        neighboring shops, till I reach Twelfth street, where Isaac B. hires me. His
                        shop is over a rag store and the smell is far-reaching. Mr. and Mrs. B. work
                        with the men and girls. There are two rooms, poor light, bad ventilation,
                        low ceilings, disgusting smells from the kitchens, the snarling,
                        fault-finding remarks of the man, the petulance of his wife, the filthy
                        condition of the place and the revolting contiguity of so many people were
                        something not to be endured. I occupied my chair in the dark, crowded room
                        fifteen minutes and left. Like David K's this shop is open all day
                        Sunday.</p>
                    <p>In the rear of Taylor street I was offered work by a tailor. He had two small
                        rooms in which men and girls were working <pb n="110"/> like slaves on
                        custom coats. There was a fire in the stove on which men heated their irons,
                        and two boxes of garbage just outside on the pavement filled the room with
                        their odors.</p>
                    <p>Leaving the field of cloth and cloaks I applied to E. A. M., the
                        confectioner, on West Jackson street. The forewoman is a thin, bloodless
                        young woman, with wild eyes and unmistakable evidences of overwork.</p>
                    <p>"No, I can't give you a place. You are too big. I want little girls. All
                        these hands have been sent to us by peddlers because they are so very poor.
                        You couldn't live on the salaries we pay. These children get $3 and the old
                        hands up-stairs $4."</p>
                    <p>The midget laborers are filling pans with chocolate and maple caramels. Young
                        boys cut the sheet of soft, brown saccharine stuff into squares which a
                        dozen little girls transferred to the tins. At deep troughs filled with
                        pop-com and gum-drops were other children filling small paper bags.
                        Up-stairs the girls worked on stick goods. Their quarters, while rude and
                        bare and hot from the steaming syrup-pots, were light and airy.</p>
                    <p>At Brougham's packing-house on Jackson street, I applied for work in the
                        canning-room. The foreman was kind. He took me out in the dark, little
                        packing-room, in which the light and breeze were fenced off by walls of tin
                        cans. The girls were pale and thin and very young. But, oh, how they did
                        paint! Each stood near a wall of cans that had just been filled with
                        meat—pressed corned beef, tongue or ham—still warm. At hand was a pot of
                        Japan paint with which the girls brushed the ends and rims of each can. I
                        told the foreman I knew I could do the work. He tried me. I daubed on the
                        paint, held the brush wrong, and got more color on my hands than on the can.
                        The girls laughed at my awkwardness; so did the foreman. I was chagrined
                        with my failure and asked for some water to clean my hands. The man gave me
                        a benzine bath and then showed me to a basin of dirty water on the <pb
                            n="111"/> surface of which a hundred or more dead flies were afloat. The
                        quarters in which these girls work are little more than deadly—no sunlight,
                        no free, fresh air, no place to sit, and the blue paint smeared over their
                        hands and arms and dripping from the breast and belt of their dresses. Their
                        wages are $5, but each is expected to paint at least 1,500 cans per day.
                        Dirty little girls in rags and broken shoes, many of their wrists not bigger
                        than your two fingers, were in the rear of the shop scouring cans, for which
                        they are paid $3 a week. The hours of toil are from 7 o'clock to 12 and from
                        1 o'clock to 5. The girls were gay and inclined to be happy in their dungeon
                        slavery, for, after all, they ate better paid than scores of help in the
                        employ of P., J. S., E. and Mrs. W.</p>
                    <p>At the suggestion of the foreman I took a Halsted streetcar for the stock
                        yards and with so much experience presented myself at the F. C. company. I
                        did not see Mr. N. K., and what is more, didn't want to see him. The girls,
                        numbering a hundred or so, were at work up on the second floor in one of the
                        numerous buildings. They painted and labeled by the piece, getting 5 cents a
                        hundred. Plenty of girls handled 2,500 cans a day, giving them a salary of
                        $7.50 a week. Experienced hands earned $9 and beginners and dryers $4 per
                        week. No provision was made for the comfort of these girls. They swept the
                        greasy floor when necessary, packed the goods and were jostled and pushed
                        about by the bloody butchers and greasy packers. All worked in cast-off
                        clothing, many literally dripping with paint. A great many of the girls were
                        Irish, but the Swedes and Germans were numerous. I cannot understand how
                        they endure the work which, while purely mechanical, requires them to be on
                        their feet from 7 to 5:30 every day, and from all I could learn they do not
                        stand it. Few with whom I talked had been in the yards five years; all
                        wanted to get married, not to have money and nice clothes and theater
                        tickets, but to get rested.</p>
                    <pb n="112"/>
                    <p>At P. D. A's packing-house the girls were paid 3 cents to 5 cents per hundred
                        for labeling and japaning cans, wages varying $6 to $9. Beginners received
                        75 cents a day for two weeks, or until they could handle 1,500 cans per day,
                        when they received $6, and were raised to the minimum figure as their skill
                        increased. As at F's, they were young girls with haggard faces, emaciated
                        figures, and work-weary bodies. At noon they sat in the windows to eat their
                        lunch, and fhe vessel on the zinc from which they slacked their thirst was
                        nothing more elaborate than a tin-can cut down. It is certainly very good of
                        Mr. A. to build Sunday-schools, educate struggling artists, buy pictures,
                        and patronize music, but these young women are human, if their senses are
                        dulled to the sickening smells of the slaughtering establishment, and a
                        clean sitting- room with neat walls and chairs in which to rest at noon and
                        clean towels for the 6 o'clock toilet, would not be wasted charity.</p>
                    <p>These girls are called "tough." Perhaps they are. Perhaps their language is
                        not chaste nor their manners pleasing, but Mr. A. and Mr. F. know as well as
                        need be known that their hearts are pure and their lives blameless.
                        Considering their origin, their nature, their surroundings, and their
                        associates they are too good to be put on the level they are.</p>
