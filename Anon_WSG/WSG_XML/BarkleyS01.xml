                    <p>Tuesday, July 10, according to instructions from The Times, I made up for the
                        role of shop-girl, and with a list of factories in one hand and gentle peace
                        in the other sailed down State street under a brown braize veil as
                        impenetrable as an iron mask. I applied at two feather factories and three
                        corset shops, but aside from the exercise up and down several flights of
                        stairs got nothing. The feather people did not need any help and the corset
                        folks had not started on the winter trade. I was treated with civility,
                        however, and given permission to "drop in in a week or so." The fifth place
                        on my list was a lace manufacturing company on State street. Ascending one
                        flight of stairs I stopped to take off my veil, and adjust my eyes to the
                        low light. That done, I looked about and finding a door marked "Office of
                        the --- Lace Manufacturing Co." with "Come in" on the glass I complied. A
                        young girl followed and leaving her to close the door I fell into a chair,
                        the only one about, and proceeded to perspire and scrutinize the place. The
                        office was not uninviting. The floor had a cheap carpet, the ceiling was
                        high and the room well ventilated and admirably <pb n="6"/> lighted. On a
                        long table that served as a sort of fortification for the private office of
                        the company were the samples -- "antique crocheted goods" -- as they are
                        listed in various shades of white. All were of different pattern and
                        unvarying ugliness. There were round tidies and oblong tidies, square mats
                        for a bureau and smaller ones of oval and circular design, intended for a
                        lamp or cushion. Behind the table, sacheting between a writing stand and a
                        desk, was a young man of 30 or so, of the blonde type, with a stationary
                        scowl between his eyebrows and an otherwise pleasing manner. That is, I
                        thought the manner pleasing till I began to get acquainted with it and then
                        my opinion changed. After a lapse of five minutes or so the fair-haired
                        gentleman turned to the young girl with a deepening of the scowl and a most
                        unalluring "Well?"</p>
                    <p>"I brought the mats back."</p>
                    <p>"Oh, you have, eh?" opening a piece of newspaper and unfolding a dozen
                        hand-made mats the size of a tea-plate. The work is carefully examined on
                        both sides and as he proceeds the scowl deepens, Without a word he tosses
                        the lot on the little table and reaches for the proffered blank the girl has
                        opened.</p>
                    <p>"What’s your name?"</p>
                    <p>"Rhafferty."</p>
                    <p>"How do you spell it?"</p>
                    <p>"R-h-a-f-f-e-r-t-y."</p>
                    <p>"Oh, yes; Martha Rhafferty," after hunting through a long list.</p>
                    <p>"Do you want more work?"</p>
                    <p>"No, sir."</p>
                    <p>"There’s plenty more if you want it."</p>
                    <p>"No; my mother don’t want me to do any more crocheting."</p>
                    <p>"Well, Mr. White isn’t in now. Can’t you come in again?"</p>
                    <p>No answer. A look of discouragement comes over the young face.</p>
                    <pb n="7"/>
                    <p>"Don’t you have to do some shopping about town?"</p>
                    <p>"No, sir."</p>
                    <p>"Well, you can wait, can’t you? Wait here. Take a chair. [I had the only
                        one.] Just go in the next room there and take a chair."</p>
                    <p>As he went to lead the way the crochet-teacher called his attention, and the
                        girl remaining I seized my chances for a bit of interviewing.</p>
                    <p>Martha showed me her contract in which the firm had agreed to refund $1 of
                        the three deposited when she had finished $15 worth of work. On the back of
                        the contract were the credit receipts of the company entered in lead pencil,
                        dating from January to July. She told me she lived in Gross Park, away out
                        on the West Side; that she helped her mother, and had been trying to earn
                        $15 since January. She received 60 cents a dozen for the mats and it took
                        her a week to crochet a dozen. "Then I must pay 10 cents car fare each time,
                        and that leaves me only 40 cents. I had to pay $3 before I could get any
                        work. I always knew how to crochet, but they made me pay $2 for lessons and
                        $1 as a security. I began in January, the first week, and now I am through.
                        I have made $15, and when they give me back the dollar I shall have $16."
                        Here is a company paying a girl of 18 $15 for six months and one week’s
                        labor.</p>
                    <p>When Mr. F. came from the work-room he was met by a boy who had brought in
                        some work and was in a hurry to be off.</p>
                    <p>"Mrs. C. sent in these mats and she wants you to receipt for them."</p>
                    <p>The paper is opened and the work inspected. The scowl deepens. There will be
                        trouble and I prick up my ears.</p>
                    <p>"I don’t like this. This is bad. They are all stained. Are you her -- her --
                        are you a relation?"</p>
                    <p>"Yes."</p>
                    <pb n="8"/>
                    <p>"Well, you must tell her to wash her hands. These goods are all sweat. I’ll
                        have to charge her for spoiling the material if it occurs again. Did she
                        tell you to ask for more work?"</p>
                    <p>"No, sir."</p>
                    <p>The poor boy is gone. Martha sits in the back room the picture of suspense
                        and the entry being made I am approached. I look like a beggar and that is
                        what I am taken for, as the pretty blonde secretary only scowls. He stands
                        and looks down at me and I sit and look up at him waiting for the lines in
                        the handsome brow to deepen, the edge of the soft brown mustache to curl,
                        and the laconic, withering "well" to break the daze. It comes.</p>
                    <p>"Have you any work?" I ask.</p>
                    <p>"Plenty. Do you want work?"</p>
                    <p>"Yes."</p>
                    <p>"What can you do?"</p>
                    <p>"Oh, I can crochet."</p>
                    <p>"This kind of work?" handing over one of the 60-cent mats.</p>
                    <p>"Yes; what do you pay?"</p>
                    <p>"Different prices. Pay by the dozen, from 60 cents to $10." "Let me have a
                        dozen of the $10 kind, please", giving my cat-colored eyes a mater voloroso
                        sort of a roll. As he caught the seraphic expression some facial machinery
                        gave a lurch that threw one side of his countenance bias for a second.
                        Reaching to the desk he pulled out the following circular and handed it to
                        me:</p>
                    <lb/>
                    <p>Office of W---L--M----Co. (Incorporated,) S-- Street, Chicago, ILL. --
                        Madame: In reply to your letter regarding the work we send out to ladies to
                        do at their homes we beg to say that we would make a large line of crochet
                        goods of our antique crochet cotton (a sample of which you will find
                        enclosed), also linen, silk, etc. We make mats, tidies, lambrequins,
                        bedspreads, shams, collars, hoods, lace edging, etc., in large
                        quantities.</p>
                    <pb n="9"/>
                    <p>We have been established here for the last five years, and have extra
                        facilities for selling goods in large lots, so we are enabled to keep our
                        workers in steady work all the time. Should you desire to work for us we
                        should be pleased to send you work on the following terms:</p>
                    <p>When you send order for work you are required to remit to us $3; $2 of this
                        is to pay us for the patterns and instructions which we shall send you with
                        each lot of new work. (We shall also send you sufficient extra material so
                        you can make a sample of each pattern sent, which you are allowed to keep
                        for yourself); $1 of the $3 you send is a deposit on the material we send,
                        and this we shall return to you at any time when you return the work and
                        wish to stop. You will be kept in steady work, paid for each lot when made
                        and returned to us in good order. Our work is all made by the dozen, and
                        prices range from 50 cents per dozen to $10 per dozen, according to amount
                        of work. An easy pattern with sample and full instructions will be sent you
                        at first, and the quality of work, and advance in prices as you adapt
                        yourself to doing it. The work will be sent you by mail, postage paid by us
                        one way. Three month’s time is allowed you to do any one dozen of articles
                        we send. This enables ladies who have only a few hours daily to spare to do
                        our work as well as those ladies who take it intending to do it
                        steadily.</p>
                    <p>We are asked many times how much a lady can earn. This depends entirely upon
                        your ability to crochet and the time you have at your command daily; ladies
                        earning from $2 to $5 weekly. We could not guarantee to anyone any stated
                        amount that they could earn, but our work is easy, and after you accustom
                        yourself to it you can do it yery rapidly.</p>
                    <p>If you desire to work for us fill out the blank below and return it to us
                        with the $3, and we will place your name on our books and send work at once
                        with full instructions. Send money by postoffice order, draft, payable to
                        our order, or registered letter at our risk.</p>
                    <p>Very truly, -----</p>
                    <p>Keep the above for reference.</p>
                    <lb/>
                    <p>W---L--M----Co., S-- Street, Chicago, ILL. - Gentlemen: Inclosed find $3 that
                        I send you to secure patterns, instructions, and material for crochet work;
                        $2 is to pay you for samples and instructions, and $1 is for deposit on
                        material which I shall demand returned to me at any time when I return to
                        you the material in my hands.</p>
                    <p>Signature..................</p>
                    <p>Town....................</p>
                    <p>County...................</p>
                    <p>Street and No. ..............</p>
                    <pb n="10"/>
                    <p>"What’s the $3 for?" I ask.</p>
                    <p>"Can’t you read? The $2 is to pay for the samples and instruction and the $1
                        as a security for our material. I don’t know who you are and if I gave you
                        the thread I might never see you again."</p>
                    <p>"I don’t need instruction. I can make the stitch and I don’t want to put any
                        such amount in samples. If you can’t trust me with a spool of thread and a
                        pattern will you sell me the material?"</p>
                    <p>"That’s not the way we do business. If you want to work for us you must
                        comply with the contract. You pay $3; that entitles you to a sample mat
                        which we teach you how to make. After you have $15 made worth of work we
                        refund the $1." "What about the other $2?"</p>
                    <p>"It goes to us for instruction and samples."</p>
                    <p>"Will I have to make the samples?"</p>
                    <p>"Yes."</p>
                    <p>"Then there are thirteen in the lace manufacturing company’s dozen?"</p>
                    <p>"If you want to put it that way, yes. But you get one of each set."</p>
                    <p>"But I don’t want any. I have a supply. Tell me how much will you sell me a
                        thirteenth of a dozen of this set for?"</p>
                    <p>"The price is on the tag."</p>
                    <p>"Ah, I see, 15 cents; and you pay 60 centsa dozen for making them, a profit
                        of $1.20. The best thing I’ve struck yet. Any stock for sale?"</p>
                    <p>The scowl becomes threatening, but I venture to ask how much thread it takes
                        to a mat for a closer calculation of the profits.</p>
                    <p>No answer is deigned.</p>
                    <p>"If I give you $3 you will give me work?"</p>
                    <p>"Yes," in a sullen tone.</p>
                    <p>"How much?"</p>
                    <pb n="11"/>
                    <p>"All you can do," brightning up a little.</p>
                    <p>"How do I know you will give me back $1 after I’ve earned $15?" I ask. "I
                        don’t know anything about you; I never heard about your firm before, and
                        there is no name on this paper."</p>
                    <p>"I guess your motives are bad. You don’t want work."</p>
                    <p>"What guarantee have you to offer of honesty or respectability?"</p>
                    <p>With glaring eyes, distended nostrils, and face crimson with rage he threw
                        down a pile of 2-cent blank books in front of me. "There’s our customers;
                        every state in the union is rep- resented; go to them if you want
                        references. Here are more, too," slaming down a sheet of paper with the
                        names and Chi- cago addresses of about forty women.</p>
                    <p>"I see you have a minimum local trade. Chicago women don’t seem overzealous
                        about the crocheting business." Then I asked him where he got a market for
                        the goods, and the name of some business man to whom I could go for
                        reference. "Now I am not going to do any more talking with you about this
                        business."</p>
                    <p>"Why? Is it a secret organization, a sort of Masonic---"</p>
                    <p>"No, it isn’t secret or Masonic, but I don’t believe you’re all right and I
                        won’t answer any more questions until I know who you are and what you
                        want."</p>
                    <p>Poor Mr. F. was so furious by this time that I thanked him for his attention
                        and bade him good afternoon.</p>
                    <p>At the foot of the stairs I waited to tie my veil on and see how Martha
                        fared, but at the expiration of thirty minutes she was still waiting for Mr.
                        W. and her $16.</p>
                    <p>Of the five women I interrogated none of them were able to earn 20 cents a
                        day All expressed a liking for the work but complained bitterly of the way
                        the concern gave out the work. For instance, bedspreads paid $10 a dozen,
                        but not more than three spreads were given to a hand and one of these was
                        the <pb n="12"/> sample. The little table-mats paid 50 cents per dozen, but
                        before a girl was able to crochet enough to live on she was obliged to take
                        collars made of fine thread in such an intricate pattern that it was an
                        utter impossibility to earn $1 a month. No woman seen had earned $15 in less
                        than six months, and one of the most skilled hands had been on a 60-cent lot
                        since June 3.</p>
                    <p>By inquiry I learned that many women paid $3 and gave up the work when they
                        saw that it was not possible to make the $15 necessary for the rebate. This
                        fact does not appear in the circulars, and it is not till after the contract
                        has been signed that the equivocal tactics of the concern are understood.
                        Several cases are on record at the Woman’s Protective Agency, but no
                        judgment has been obtained, as the agreement stands valid before the law.
                        All that can be done in the matter is to warn the public against a concern
                        legally incorporated to grind the life out of the women and girls
                        unfortunate enough to patronize it.</p>
