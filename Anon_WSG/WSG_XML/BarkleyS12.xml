                    <p>"When we're late and get locked out we go to the dago shop. Were you ever in
                        a dago's?"</p>
                    <p>"No."</p>
                    <p>"Well, you can always tell them by the 'Ladies Entrance.' Some of them are
                        real nice, with beautiful carpets and lace curtains and mirrors on the wall.
                        There's a place over on Madison street where you can get crackers and pop
                        for a nickel. Some of the girls go down-town and shop, but when it rains the
                        police let us wait in the tunnel."</p>
                    <p>"How long?" I asked.</p>
                    <p>"Till 9 o'clock. You have to be here at 7:30 o'clock, and if you're late the
                        door is locked and you can't get in till 9."</p>
                    <p>The above conversation took place in the D. F. D. Company's place on Canal
                        street, where I applied for work Saturday morning. The building is a
                        substantial brick and extends back to the river. The factory is on the third
                        floor and reached by two long flights of stairs that needed sweeping and
                        repairing. I suppose the surroundings were suitable for the business carried
                        on, but they were far from comfortable and wholly uncharming. Overhead were
                        the bare rafters, heavy with dust and festooned with cobwebs. In two of the
                        four brick walls were six or more windows that admitted a fair quantity of
                        light. The front half of the room contained the offices of the concern
                        inclosed in glass partitions, about which were huge bins filled with
                        feathers. There were plums from nearly all the bam-yard fowls and they
                        towered almost to the gloomy <pb n="81"/> rafters. In the east half of the
                        ware-room were the various work-tables built of scantling and boarded at the
                        sides to keep the fluffy feathers from blowing about. In front of each
                        "feather-board" was a chair or stool about which were three or more boxes or
                        receptacles into which the wing, tail, body, and down feathers were placed
                        by the girls as they sorted them. The machinery that furnished the power
                        filled one corner, where the binders and sizers were at work.</p>
                    <p>While there was nothing obnoxious about the material and no foulness in the
                        atmosphere, the air was heavy with dust and dirt, and lint-specks from the
                        feathers floated about in little clouds, making respiration painful to the
                        uninitiated. A fore- man had charge of the factory, and his disciplin, while
                        firm was just and reasonably kind. The girls worked by the piece, and no
                        unpleasant or unmanly methods were resorted to. The only rule enforced was
                        punctuality. The factory opens at 7:30 and closes at 5:40, allowing
                        forty-five minutes at noon, and all hands are obliged to be prompt.</p>
                    <p>No unusual provision has been made for the comfort of the girls. Their
                        dressing rooms had nothing but privacy to recommend it, but as much cannot
                        be said of the toilet closet. There was the regulation rust-covered sink,
                        with its soggy wood-work and solitary faucet, and a two-yard crash towel,
                        which the girls take turn in laundering. Owing to the extreme buoyancy of
                        the feathers windows have to be kept closed and the impurities of the air
                        are not often removed.</p>
                    <p>I assorted feathers with a young girl named Annie. She was an interesting
                        child, with exquisitely modeled arms and pretty little dimpled hands that
                        worked into the pile of "skirt" feathers with almost imperceptable rapidity.
                        She was dressed in an old blue bunting skirt that was ragged and her cotton
                        waist was torn at the side and the sleeves worn to the elbow. Her shoes
                        scarcely protected her feet from the dusty floor, but she said she wore them
                        "to save the others."</p>
                    <pb n="82"/>
                    <p>She taught me to select the "bodies" and "downs," and after pointing out the
                        difference in the "tails" and "wings" told me to "pick." I did so till I had
                        feathers in my pockets and ears, in my hair and nostrils, and all over me.
                        They stuck in my woolen waist, got between my teeth and into my my mouth and
                        eyes till I could see nothing but flukes and stems, and could tell the
                        "sides," "tails," and "breast" by the taste. It was all I could do to keep
                        from suffocating. Annie said I would get used to the dirt in a little while
                        and thought I ought to be able to pick five pounds a day in a few weeks.</p>
                    <p>Annie had a good head for figures and some some pretty sound ideas regarding
                        the condition of the working girls.</p>
                    <p>"I get 7 cents a pound for sorting the quills and 10 cents for the down
                        feathers. When I work hard I can pick ten pounds of the quills and three of
                        the down. That makes $1 a day for five days. We close Saturday at noon and
                        then I make 60 cents or so. About $5.50 a week. It's hard to make any more
                        this hot weather. In the winter any good hand can make $7 a week, but very
                        few earn more. I have been at the business for about three years. When I
                        commenced there were months that I didn't make more than enough to pay for
                        my car-fare and lunches. The girls who size or measure the feathers get 1
                        1/4 cents a pound, but the machine moves slowly and they only earn about $4
                        a week. Girls who split and bunch feathers earn between $5 and $6, and those
                        who sort the long tail and side feathers get 1 cent a pound. The best hand
                        in the shop picks 80 pounds a day. Awful quick worker, but that's not $5 a
                        week."</p>
