Referring to house servants he said that while they were exposed to the greatest temptations almost invariably they had shown themselves to be honest. In most households where the services of a domestic are required there are always valuables in the form of jewelry, plate, or clothing that an inmate of the household could easily appropriate. Frequently the help are left in charge of the house during the vacation months, and yet it is a rare thing for a trusted house girl to take advantage of her opportunities to defraud. In my experience on the bench I do not remember to have had but one servant girl before me charged with theft, and I had to force the tears back from my eyes when she told her story. She said she was a married woman and had a young baby. Her husband had deserted her, stolen the child, and gone to St. Paul. She frankly admitted that she had stolen the jewelry and pawned it to secure money to follow her husband and recover her child. I managed to uphold the majesty of the law and at the same time did not interfere with her search for her child.</said><!-- 2016-07-06: nll: There is no closing quote here! --></p>
