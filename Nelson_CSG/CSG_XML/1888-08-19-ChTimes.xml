               <p>Usually <q type="double">popping the question</q> is a trying ordeal to a man, even when none but the two parties most interested are present. What must it have been in this case when half a score of pairs of bright eyes were gazing in astonishment and as many ears were trained to catch every syllable? Usually, too, the woman addressed is very much embarrassed, or seems to be. This one was not. With a musical laugh followed by an interrogation point, she awaited further developments, <persName ref="#workingGirl">Emma</persName>, the American girl, rallying her good-naturedly the while.</p>

The reporter for <name ref="#CT">THE TIMES</name>, to whom the question was addressed, answer in this manner:</rdg></app></p>
               <p><app><rdg wit="#CT021">Yesterday accompanied by an inspector from the health department, I vistied and inspected <orgName ref="#Doremus" type="exposedCompany">Doremus laundry</orgName> at <placeName type="address" ref="#Doremus">269 and 271 South Paulina street</placeName>. The front is a two-story brick, a new building only partially occupied as yet, but the work-shop is an old three-story frame in the rear. Here about ninety girls and ten men work ten hours a day, and three of the girls are less than 15 years old. Last week three of the girls succumbed to the heat, one of them being so completely prostrated that she had to be sent home in a carriage. The upright box on the second floor, called by courtesy a closet, is disgustingly unclean, but it is a summer resort as compared with the one on the third floor. <s>At the time of <seg><w type="adj" subtype="poss" ana="#reporter">my</w> <w type="noun">visit</w></seg><!-- rjp: not positive this is Nelson reporting?? Don't think it is soooo who gets the ana? --> not a particle of water flowed into it, and it could only be flushed and cleaned by means of buckets full of water, brought by hand and dumped into it.</s> <s>It was <seg><w type="adj" subtype="poss">nobody's</w> <w type="noun">business</w></seg><!-- rjp: oh boy who is the ana? do we leave it blank? options? more general and doesn't need an ana reference or that it is meant as an employee?? --> to bring in this water.</s> Seldom was it fetched at all. Your imagination can supply the rest. On this floor are employed some forty women and several men. The city ordinance requires that there shall be separate closets for every twenty <choice><sic>employes</sic><reg resp="#rjp">employees</reg></choice>.</rdg><rdg wit="#WSGC23"></rdg></app></p>
               <p><app><rdg wit="#CT021">This is <damage agent="blurred" unit="word" quantity="5"/><unclear/> premises. And <damage agent="blurred" unit="word" quantity="5"/><unclear/> moral anathema. Back of this horrible hole is a storage-room filled with an accumulation of rubbish that would smell to heaven were it not for the fact that it is too near hades for aught but a cyclone to cover the intervening distance. <s>There is scant room for two persons to pass each other. And yet in this filthy hole the girls remove <seg><w type="adj" subtype="poss" ana="#workingGirl">their</w> street <w type="noun">clothes</w></seg> on entering the establishment in the morning, and in this same hole they don them at the end of the <seg><w type="adj" subtype="poss">day's</w> <w type="noun">toil</w></seg>.</s> The least experienced goes through this ordeal for $3 a week. Older hands endure for $3 a week. Older hands endure it for $5, $6, $8, and the one or two exceptional cases for $13 a week. I will guarentee to prove every statement I have made to you by the proprietors themselves. Is there anything sensational in this statement?"</rdg><rdg wit="#WSGC23"></rdg></app></p>
               <p><app><rdg wit="#CT021">Another sample institution is <orgName ref="#Loomis" type="exposedCompany">Loomis laundry</orgName>, at <placeName type="address" ref="#Loomis">193 and 195 West Monroe street</placeName>, somprising a one-story and basement shanty. <s>If any man has a particle of doubt as to the truthfulness of <seg><w type="adj" subtype="poss" ana="#CT"><name ref="#CT">THE TIMES</name>'</w> <w type="noun">representations</w></seg> he can visit this or any other establishment that has been inspected and see for himself.</s> In the wash-room in the basement men and women wade around in slops half an inch deep. The only redeeming feature of the disgusting premises is that one of the dirtiest of the dirty closets is under the sidewalk, some four feet removed from the windows. so that part of the stench escapes the twenty-five girls employed, and is gratuitously distributed among the patrons of the sidewalk above. In every instance <name ref="#CT">THE TIMES</name> has given names and street numbers so that any person taking an interest in the labor question, and having the slightest doubt as to the truthfulness of the reports can satisfy himself with but little trouble. Of course it must be understood that there is a difference between.</rdg><rdg wit="#WSGC23"></rdg></app></p>

As a result of the inspection hundreds that were in an unsavory condition a month ago have been placed in a cleanly and fairly sanitary condition. If nothing else should be accomplished by this investigation the results would amply repay the effort to better the condition of the working women. But more marked results are to come.</rdg><rdg wit="#WSGC23"></rdg></app></p>

Most of the curtains for the <orgName ref="#PPcar">Pullman</orgName> cars are made on the upper floor of this building, the sewing girls averaging about $7 per week. Everything possible is done by machinery. The stairways are lighted and ample. There are fire escapes. The closets are separate and in good condition.

            <!-- RJP: continued after this article there is a column title "PUBLIC OPINION" with letters to the editor regarding the Nelson series. The ending column under this title is partially legible and can be transcribed; however, the continuing column (the far right column of the page) is cut off in the available NYU PDFS. Ideally the project would want to have all parts of the series including these direct responses in our database, but until we are able to re-photograph these articles the transcription will have to end here or sit mid-paragraph unfinished. Note: these responses are also not included in the Barkley text.-->
