               <p>For dismal surroundings, economy of comforts, and heartless treatment, to the <orgName ref="#BostonStore" type="exposedCompany">Boston store</orgName> belongs the palm.</p>
               <p>I did not work in that establishment although I tried very hard to do so. I was in the store at 8 o'clock on Friday morning as arranged with <persName ref="#employer"><!-- 2016-07-14: nll: I did some research and Mr. Hillman was the manager of the Boston store for a while in 1888, does this mean he's the employer? -->Mr. Hillman</persName>, who had partially promised to hire me. <said who="#employer" ana="male">One of the girls in the hosiery department</said> he had said <said who="#employer" ana="male">is sick, and if she doesn't come back Friday morning I will try you.</said></p>
               <p>I could not find the gentleman, although I hunted the main floor and the floors above and below. <seg><phr><w type="poss" ana="#nellNelson">My</w> <w type="noun">plan</w> of fluctuation</phr> was to take the elevator up one story and walk down, then ride up two and walk down the third flight, in that way I took in the entire store and a great part of the <choice><sic>employes</sic><reg resp="#nll">employees</reg></choice>.</seg> I began at the bottom and spent a full hour in the basement, where I saw so much and suffered so much that the upper floors had no surprises for me. In the first place the atmosphere was almost unendurable.</p>
               <p>Hot! It must have been 100 degrees above!</p>
               <p>Out in the open air not a breeze was stirring and the heat was sizzling. Down where I was I could not see a single opening to admit the air, fiery as it was, excepting the open door at the extreme southeast<!-- 2016-07-15: nll: The word 'southeast' is hyphenated because of the linebreak, but I'm not sure if it should still be hyphenated or not. --> corner of the floor, leading up a short flight of steps to the sidewalk. About this doorway so many goods were piled and draped and hung that the passage of air was obstructed. There must have been forty, and there may<!-- 2016-07-15: nll: I believe the word 'have' should be in between 'may' and 'been', but I don't know if I should add a choice tag here or not? --> been eighty, clerks, cash boys, and girls on this floor and five times that number of customers surged in and out under the glaring rays of gas-jets and electric burners. <seg>Babies squirmed and cried under the suffocating heat; children screamed and fretted; men and women fanned and wiped <phr><w type="poss" ana="#unidentified">their</w> <w type="noun">faces</w></phr>, but the little cash-girls and the languid clerks endured <phr><w type="poss" ana="#workingGirl">their</w> <w type="noun">prison</w></phr> uncomplaining.</seg> Add to the heat from gas-jets, electric lights, and machinery, the exhalations from so many people, the moldy smell from the damaged goods, the dampness of the freshly mopped floor, the fumes from a stray disinfectant, and the mildew and earthy odor that lurked in dark corners, and you have some idea of the quarters in which customers are invited to look for bargains and where helpless, honest, freeborn American men and women, boys and girls are forced to work for clothes and bread.</p>
               <p>What about the soul? It's mockery to mention it to these slaves in such a dungeon.</p>
               <p>On a rude plank door painted black is the work <hi rend="double">Ladies.</hi> The irony of it! <hi rend="double">Serfs</hi> would be less impertinent and <hi rend="double">bond-women</hi> or <hi rend="double">drudges</hi> better than either.</p>
               <p><seg>The door yields to <phr><w type="poss" ana="#nellNelson">my</w> <w type="noun">touch</w></phr></seg> and I enter the toilet and cloak room. The atmosphere is so intense and the effluvia so offensive that I am almost stifled. A window about eighteen inches square has been cut in the side of the staircase leading from the street, and <seg>here I stand, <phr><w type="poss" ana="#nellNelson">my</w> <w type="noun">face</w></phr> turned up to the clouds of dust that float in from the feet and skirts of the passing customers.</seg> By and by I get accustomed to the foulness and turn round to explore the place. The floor is black and wet from recent mopping; the janitor has swept all the previous day's rubbish in from the basement and it forms a big pile behind the door. There is only one gas-jet in the room and I do not see the wet sweepings until I have stepped in them. On either side of the inclosure are the cloak-boxes, communication to which is afforded by a window a foot square. A young and very pretty colored woman is in one section and in the opposite window is a little boy possibly 13 years old. <seg>All the female help pass <phr><w type="poss" ana="#workingGirl">their</w> <w type="noun">hats</w>, <w type="noun">wraps</w>, and <w type="noun">lunches</w></phr> through these windows, and they are put in a cubby-hole the number of which corresponds to the number of the clerk.</seg> The smell of mold forcibly assails the senses, and mingled with the foul odor from the adjoining closets the effect on the lunches must be left to the imagination. On the east side of the partition is the toilet inclosure, built like the rest, under the pavement. But for the perforated coal-hole covers overhead the place would be pitch dark. It is damp, dirty, and smelly, the stone sidewalk forming the ceiling and gray flagstones the floor. The closets, four or five in number, have not even the luxury of doors, and in a space at one end is a dirty little iron sink into which runs a stream of water. As only two girls can approach the narrow trough for water at a time it is not hard for the reader to understand how great a luxury this single stream of clear, cool water is to the slave-girls. At one time I counted twenty-eight girls in this filthy little hole, which is unfit for cattle and in which no man would water a faithful dog.</p>
               <p><seg>When I had accustomed myself to the deadly smell that pervaded the place it was 9:30 o'clock and the girls were beginning to come in to wash <phr><w type="poss" ana="#workingGirl">their</w> <w type="noun">hands</w></phr> and clean up after arranging <phr><w type="poss" ana="#workingGirl">their</w> <w type="noun">stock</w></phr>. About the little mirror were seven girls, some combing <phr><w type="poss" ana="#workingGirl">their</w> <w type="noun">hair</w></phr>, some dressing it, and all trying to get a peep at <phr><w type="poss" ana="#workingGirl">their</w> wan <w type="noun">faces</w></phr>. The closets were crowded, and while three young girls were washing at the sink five moved about with bits of soap in <phr><w type="poss" ana="#workingGirl">their</w> <w type="noun">hands</w></phr>, <phr><w type="poss" ana="#workingGirl">their</w> <w type="noun">arms</w> and <w type="noun">faces</w></phr> covered with lather. The soap may have been furnished by the house, but of the absence of towels I am positive. Most of the girls had <phr><w type="poss" ana="#workingGirl">their</w> own <w type="noun">comb</w>, <w type="noun">soap</w>, and <w type="noun">towel</w></phr>, and where do you suppose they carried them?</seg></p>
               <p><seg>In the bosom of <phr><w type="poss" ana="#workingGirl">their</w> <w type="noun">dresses</w></phr>.</seg></p>
               <p><seg>I cautioned a girl who had opened the front of <phr><w type="poss" ana="#workingGirl">her</w> <w type="noun">waist</w></phr> against putting the we towel so near <phr><w type="poss" ana="#workingGirl">her</w> <w type="noun">breast</w></phr>, but she only laughed and said <said who="#workingGirl" ana="female">nothin'll hurt me.</said></seg></p>
               <p><said who="#nellNelson" ana="female">But it is wet and may cause a lung trouble.</said></p>
               <p><said who="#workingGirl" ana="female">Indeed it won't. I used to put it here all last winter and it didn't hurt me. When it was awful cold I wore it home and I never even had a cold.</said> <seg>As she spoke she folded the little towel, and laying it against <phr><w type="poss" ana="#workingGirl">her</w> <w type="noun">under-waist</w></phr> buttoned <phr><w type="poss" ana="#workingGirl">her</w> <w type="noun">dress</w></phr> and went to the hole in the north cloak-box for a glass of lemonade. I told her I was very thirsty and asked for a drink.</seg></p>
               <p><said who="#workingGirl" ana="female">Oh, you have to pay. It's 3 cents a glass.</said></p>
               <p><seg>The colored girl and <phr><w type="poss" ana="#workingGirl">her</w> little white <w type="noun" subtype="refTo" ana="#workingGirl">slave</w></phr> had a bucket full of the beverage&#8212;a very excellent article, by the way&#8212;which they retailed at the price stated. The ebony vender refused to sell to me till I convinced her that I expected to begin in the hosiery stock as soon as <persName ref="#employer">Mr. Hillman</persName> came down. The girl with the wet damask in <phr><w type="poss" ana="#workingGirl">her</w> <w type="noun">bosom</w></phr> drained <phr><w type="poss" ana="#workingGirl">her</w> <w type="noun">glass</w></phr> to the last drop, ate the slices of lemon rind and pulp, and with the help of <phr><w type="poss" ana="#workingGirl">her</w> <w type="noun">finger</w></phr> transferred every gram of undissolved sugar to <phr><w type="poss" ana="#workingGirl">her</w> <w type="noun">mouth</w></phr>. She lapped the mouth of the glass with <phr><w type="poss" ana="#workingGirl">her</w> <w type="noun">tongue</w></phr> and when the boy took it from the ledge it was as dry as could be. I could not get her to confide <phr><w type="poss" ana="#workingGirl">her</w> <w type="noun">salary</w></phr>, but she said: <said who="#workingGirl" ana="female">It ain't nothing like $5. For two years I only got $3, but now I have more.</said></seg></p>
               <p><seg>I found a girl named <persName ref="#workingGirl">Bessie</persName> in the closetroom<!-- 2016-07-19: nll: This is hyphenated in the article because of a linebreak, but it just looks wrong without the hyphen. I'll let someone else decide what it should be. --> lying against the wall, the very picture of death. <phr><w type="poss" ana="#workingGirl">Her</w> <w type="noun">face</w></phr> had no more color in it than a china cup, <phr><w type="poss" ana="#workingGirl">her</w> <w type="noun">lips</w></phr> were blue, dark lines increased the brilliancy of <phr><w type="poss" ana="#workingGirl">her</w> big blue <w type="noun">eyes</w></phr>, and <phr><w type="poss" ana="#workingGirl">her</w> <w type="noun">hands</w></phr> were cold and clammy. She told me she was <hi rend="double">aweful sick,</hi> but <phr><w type="poss" ana="#workingGirl">her</w> <w type="noun">mother</w></phr> made her come because she didn't want her to lose <phr><w type="poss" ana="#workingGirl">her</w> <w type="noun">place</w></phr>.</seg></p>
               <p><said who="#workingGirl" ana="female">The floor walker 'ud leave me go home if I ast him, but I haven't any car-fare and I don't want to walk.

               <p><said who="#workingGirl" ana="female">No; if I ride in the air I'll be better before I get to the bridge.</said></p>
               <p>I bought her a glass of lemonade and gave her <hi rend="double">tea pennies</hi> for a week, after which we became quite confidential.</p>
               <p><said who="#workingGirl" ana="female"><seg>I get $2 a week here and give it to <phr><w type="poss" ana="#workingGirl">my</w> <w type="noun">mother</w></phr> to buy meat.</seg> Sometimes I ride home, but them's the days that I don't buy tea, 'cause it costs too much for both. The tea is 3 cents a cup and the car fare, if you ride both ways, is 10 cents, and that's 13 cents.</said></p>
               <p>Seventy-eight cents subtracted from $2 would leave a precious small sum for meat.</p>
               <p><said who="#workingGirl" ana="female">The most I ever spent is 50 cents a week. That's how much mother let's me keep out. Oh, they're kind of good to us. <seg>Last night when it rained <persName ref="#employer">Mr. Hillman</persName> gave nickels to the cash-girls that didn't have car fare nor gossamers. But I guess he'll keep it out of <phr><w type="poss" ana="#workingGirl">their</w> <w type="noun">wages</w></phr> payday.</seg> Some of the clerks don't be good to us. They pull us everywhere and push us when we don't go fast, and we never dast ride in the elevator. <seg>The clerks can, but the cash-girls has to walk. They don't fine us if we come late, though, and they do the clerks, some 15 cents and some 25 cents, and if any of us is sick we lose the whole day out of <phr><w type="poss" ana="#workingGirl">our</w> <w type="noun">wages</w></phr>. The one I like most is <persName ref="#foreperson">Miss Gannon</persName>; she is awful good; she puts three lumps in the tea, and trusts the girls when they haven't any tea pennies.</seg></said></p>
               <p><seg>A larger girl, possibly <damage unit="chars" quantity="2" agent="blurred"/><unclear><supplied resp="#nll">13</supplied></unclear>, showed me <phr><w type="poss" ana="#workingGirl">her</w> odd <w type="noun">shoes</w></phr>. <said who="#workingGirl" ana="female">I'm wearing this one with the tipes to break it in.

               <p>A mite of a cash girl who wore broken slippers said she had better shoes at home, but it was so hard running all day that she couldn't wear them.</p>
               <p>One of a cluster of girls from the grocery floor who were earning $3 and $3.50 a week said: <said who="#workingGirl" ana="female">People talk bad about the <orgName ref="#BostonStore" type="exposedCompany">Boston store</orgName>, but it's as good as any of them. We needn't be at the store till 8 in the morning, and they never fine us if we're late.

Much of the talk I heard was coarse, indictive of ignorance and low breeding, but I saw no evidence of depravity or viciousness. One hears a great deal about the purchase of the shop-girl, but the insinuations are as false as they are base.

I spent an hour or more on the main floor watching the swarming customers joggle one-another and haggle with the young girls who waited on them. So many people in the densely-stocked, over-crowded, ill-vertilated room polluted the atmosphere, making the strong weak and the weak sick. Every available foot of space was utilized, some of the counters consisting of common pine b<damage unit="chars" quantity="2" agent="blurred"/><unclear><supplied resp="#nll">ow</supplied></unclear>s on the side of which emaciated children in<damage unit="chars" quantity="3" agent="blurred"/><unclear/>ured fringes, trimmings, ribbons, and cheap <damage unit="word" quantity="1" agent="blurred"/><unclear/>. One of these <hi rend="single">troughs,</hi> filled with Hamburg edging, was placed between the two elevators, and the little girls in charge were knocked and pushed about by the hurrying crowd in a most unseemly manner. <seg>I did not see any girl sitting down nor any provision for a momentary rest. <damage unit="word" quantity="1" agent="blurred"/><unclear><supplied resp="#nll">There</supplied></unclear> was no mistaking the poverty of the <damage unit="word" quantity="2" agent="blurred"/><unclear/> in which these hapless young creatures <damage unit="word" quantity="1" agent="blurred"/><unclear/> for <phr><w type="poss" ana="#workingGirl">their</w> <w type="noun">garments</w></phr> were old and shabby and in many cases unclean, unkempt, and <damage unit="word" quantity="1" agent="blurred"/><unclear><supplied resp="#nll">unsoliable</supplied></unclear>.

               <p><placeName type="city">CHICAGO</placeName>, Aug. 5.&#8212;TO THE EDITOR: <persName ref="#nellNelson">Nell Nelson</persName> is undoubtedly working with the object of benefiting the girl and women bread-winners of <placeName type="city">Chicago</placeName>, and will no doubt succeed in creating many needed changes in the management of stores and factories, and wages paid <choice><sic>employes</sic><reg resp="#nll">employees</reg></choice>; but knowing some facts about cloak-making and cloak-makers I can see numbers of things in which <persName ref="#nellNelson">N. N.</persName> has held them up in a wrong light, and exaggerated the injustice of employer to employed.</p>
               <p>I am told by a young lady who has been for five years a cloak-maker, and worked in not a few factories in the city, that a girl with any ability need not earn less than $7 to $10 per week, and many average the latter wages, and in good parts of the season make as high as $16 per week. The factories pay by the piece, so it will be seen that one stands an equal show with another. <seg><phr><w type="poss" ana="#unidentified">My</w> <w type="noun" subtype="refTo" ana="#workingGirl">informant</w></phr> also states that a large number of the girls who work at cloak-making are those with homes at which they reside, and are, therefore, not obliged to do full work all the time in order to live; and there are also marrie dwomen in the factories. She says that oftentimes the prices given for pieces are not in proportion to the profits realized on them by the manufacturer, but that, on account of it being impossible to get co-operation among the girls in demanding better pay, they have to all submit or give up <phr><w type="poss" ana="#workingGirl">their</w> <w type="noun">postitions</w></phr>.</seg> In regard to lunches, it is a mistake that any of them are obliged to go without eating at noontime, and that as brown bread is <damage unit="word" quantity="1" agent="blurred"/><unclear><supplied resp="#nll">dearer</supplied></unclear> than white those who eat it do so from preference, and light lunches are not a matter of necessity, but of choice.</p>
               <p>This young lady said: <said who="#workingGirl" ana="female">I wish <persName ref="#nellNelson">Nell Nelson</persName> could see the luncheon brought by the girl who sits next to me.

               <p>It is undoubtedly true that too many, if not all, the buildings used by factories are improperly ventilated, and not healthfully, not to say pleasantly, equipped in different ways; but if any person is led into the belief entertained by some of those whose answers appear in the columns of <name ref="#CT">THE TIMES</name> that domestic service is a haven of relief to which they may at any time flee, let them investigate the <hi rend="double">girls'</hi> or <hi rend="double">servants'</hi> room as provided by nine-tneths of the families in the city. Imagine yourself going to seek refreshing repose in such a place after a day of sweeping, scrubbing, washing, ironing, and cooking over a hot range on a day when the thermometer registers 90 degrees in the shade, and judge for yourself the improvement that would be on factory work, at which one gets at least two daily walks in as fresh air as the city affords, unless the street-car is preferred.</p>
               <p><seg>It is a very fortunate thing for working women that the world is not made up of men of the chivalric spirit of <hi rend="double">S. S.

               <p><placeName type="city">CHICAGO</placeName>, Aug. 5.&#8212;TO THE EDITOR: I have read with much interest <persName ref="#nellNelson">Miss Nelson's</persName> articles on <hi rend="double">City Slave Girls</hi> and the letters written by other parties. I think if <persName ref="#nellNelson">Miss Nelson</persName> would investigate these <hi rend="double">pleasant homes</hi> and <hi rend="double">bright firesides</hi> which are held up to the girls she would find a field as great or greater than the one she is now working in. I am sure the persons who advise the girls to go to the country or do housework in the city could not go themselves as experienced girls. <seg>I have had to earn <phr><w type="poss" ana="#workingGirl">my</w> <w type="noun">living</w></phr>, and know whereof I speak.</seg> I have tried many different occupations for women. When I was a school teacher I heard teachers say housework was easier than teaching, but none of them ever changed; and speaking from experience I prefer teaching. When I tried dress-making the doctor advised me to do housework as being easier and healthier. I am sure the good doctor didn't know what he was talking about. <seg>I do wish some of those who advise housework so strongly would go and get <phr><w type="poss" ana="#workingGirl">my</w> <w type="noun">experience</w></phr>.</seg></p>
               <p>If you are a school-teacher, dress-maker, bookkeeper, or shop girl you can go in good society; but just go at housework and see the difference. You are looked on as only fit to live in the kitchen or basement. The good board and lodging they speak of was worth $4.50 a week means whatever is left over after the family have had all they want. <seg>If anything is very nice there won't be a bite left, and if anything is not so good that is what the girl will have for <phr><w type="poss" ana="#workingGirl">her</w> <w type="noun">dinner</w></phr>.</seg> I have worked as nurse girl in a family where they didn't provide enough for a child let alone a nurse and kitchen girl, after they were through, and we have had ot go out and buy bread to eat with out hard-earned money, for I only got $<damage unit="chars" quantity="1" agent="blurred"/><unclear><supplied resp="#nll">4</supplied></unclear>.50 a week for taking care of three children and doing the second work in a four-story house. The lodgings are either in the basement, where you will roast in the summer, or in the garret, where you will freeze in winter, with nothing in the room but a cheap bed, <damage unit="word" quantity="1" agent="blurred"/><unclear><supplied resp="#nll">mean</supplied></unclear> clothes, and a broken chair. <seg>I never had a carpet on <phr><w type="poss" ana="#workingGirl">my</w> <w type="noun">floor</w></phr> or any furniture in all the places where I ever worked. I know for $4.50 a week I can get much better board ad lodging than that. I know both sides of the question. I broke <phr><w type="poss" ana="#workingGirl">my</w> <w type="noun">health</w></phr> all down at housework and I know how hard it is. I don't blame girls, for I know no <damage unit="word" quantity="1" agent="blurred"/><unclear/>, refined girl can stand to do the work that is expected of a domestic for $3 a week. Then <phr><w type="poss" ana="#workingGirl">her</w> <w type="noun">feelings</w></phr> are hurt and she is treated as if she didn't know anything and was only fit to be a drudge. <phr><w type="poss" ana="#workingGirl">Her</w> <w type="noun">chances</w></phr> are very poor of getting a nice young man for a husband, as men seem to prefer girls who work at anything but housework&#8212;they don't want a <hi rend="double">hired girl</hi> for <phr><!-- 2016-08-18: nll: Their refers to young men seeking wives... --><w type="poss" ana="#unidentified">their</w> <w type="noun" subtype="refTo" ana="#workingGirl">wives</w></phr>&#8212;while teachers, dressmakers, clerks, or shop-girls can marry as well as the wealthiest of girls.</seg></p>
               <p><seg>When <phr><w type="poss" ana="#workingGirl">my</w> young lady <w type="noun" subtype="refTo" ana="#workingGirl">friends</w></phr> talk about working, and ask me what I think they had better do, I never advise housework. I tell them <phr><w type="poss" ana="#workingGirl">my</w> <w type="noun">experience</w></phr> in the different occupations, and end up by telling them it is all hard, everything that you have to do to earn a living, but housework and canvassing are the hardest of all. Housework is drudgery in every sense of the word.</seg> I hate to read so many letters saying they have no sympathy for the girls just because they won't be household slaves instead of factory slaves. I hope <persName ref="#nellNelson">Nell Nelson</persName> will continue to expose the working girls' condition, and may God<!-- 2016-08-18: nll: Is God a persName? --> give them strength to keep them till better days come.</p>

               <p><placeName type="city">OSKALOOSA</placeName>, <placeName type="state">Iowa</placeName>, Aug. 6.&#8212;TO THE EDITOR: <seg>I have been much interested in reading the <hi rend="double">Slave Girl</hi> articles in <name ref="#CT">THE TIMES</name>, and although I agree that the prices paid are miserably poor, yet the question arises <hi rend="double">Would a man of business be justified in paying more for a commodity than <phr><w type="poss" ana="#employer">his</w> <w type="noun" subtype="refTo" ana="#employer">neighbor</w></phr>?</hi> I may me told that were all manufacturers to adopt an equal schedule of prices to competition would be unaltered. Very true; but who among the readers of <name ref="#CT">THE TIMES</name> does not know how <phr><w type="poss" ana="#unidentified">our</w> <w type="noun">women</w></phr> do <phr><w type="poss" ana="#unidentified">their</w> <w type="noun">shopping</w></phr>, and some of those who have been the loudest in <phr><w type="poss" ana="#employer">their</w> <w type="noun">cries</w></phr> against <hi rend="double">the brutes</hi> would be among the first to wail and bemoan the <hi rend="double">high-pricedness</hi> (if I may coin a word) of <phr><w type="poss" ana="#employer">their</w> <w type="noun">cloaks</w></phr> and the other articles of wearing apparel?</seg></p>
               <p>Now a word to the uninitiated wo read that one girl only made 63 cents in one week. <seg>Factory girls are, unfortunately, and as a rule, inclined to live beyond <phr><w type="poss" ana="#workingGirl">their</w> <w type="noun">sphere</w></phr>, and when they have been out of an evening it is nothing next day in the shop but a continual ding dong of who danced with this person or that one, and what she wore, and what someone else wore, and I have seen work neglected and spoiled by useless, frivolous talking.</seg> I am opposed to the <hi rend="double">mute</hi> system, but I also as strenuously oppose an endless clatter, clatter, clatter all day long.</p>
               <p><persName ref="#nellNelson">Miss Nelson</persName> speaks in heartrending accents of girls tunning a sewing-machine in broked shoes and even with no shoes at all. If <persName ref="#nellNelson">Miss Nelson</persName> were to attempt to run a machine, not one day, but every day, she would find that a pair of broken shoes or no shoes at all would be about the most comfortable way in which to work, as all of the work is done by the ankle, and a stiff shoe, or even a whole shoe, hampers the foot.</p>
               <p><seg>I do not for a moment wish it understood that factory girls should not go to <hi rend="double">sociables,</hi> or that any kind of amusement is beyond them; but let the pleasure be in harmony with the hours of <phr><w type="poss" ana="#workingGirl">their</w> <w type="noun">work</w></phr>. I ask the girls in all fairness is not the treatment that you receieve, in a large measure, due to <phr><w type="poss" ana="#workingGirl">your</w> own <w type="noun">acts</w></phr>?</seg></p>

               </list>
               <p><placeName type="city">CHICAGO</placeName>, Aug. 6.&#8212;TO THE EDITOR: Allow me to say, that hired girls are not one but better treated than the factory girls. They are made to work from 4 a. m. until 9 p. m., and all they get isn't much. I have a nice little girl only 12 years old that went to a place on <placeName type="locRef">Warren avenue</placeName> to be a nurse girl for a child of 5 years. <seg>She was made to take care of it all day and sit by <phr><w type="poss" ana="#unidentified">its</w> <w type="noun">bed</w></phr> until 10 o'clock at night.</seg> She worked seven days for $<damage unit="chars" quantity="1" agent="blurred"/><unclear><supplied resp="#nll">1</supplied></unclear> per week. <seg>When she asked for an afternoon they could not think of such a thing. So she came home and can be seen on <placeName type="locRef">West Madison street</placeName> every evening with <phr><w type="poss" ana="#workingGirl">her</w> little <w type="noun">basket</w> of flowers</phr> selling buttonhole bouquets; and while it is not very nice to have children on the street she can make $1 in two hours where she would have to work a week for it.</seg> Misfortune has placed us where we are obliged to work and try and do anything that is honorable for a living. So let the ladies treat the girls better and they can find plenty that would be glad of a good home and they would be good girls.</p>
