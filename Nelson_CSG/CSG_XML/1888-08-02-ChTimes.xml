                        about the business but was anxious to learn and get work. He didn't know <said who="#employer" ana="male">how a sewing

                        an empty

                        with rags and paper and the dust was heavy on the walls and wood-work and in one
                            corner was a good-sized

                        for entrance, but there was so much noise within that the door remained fast. When

                        the business. All they did was to <hi rend="double">strip</hi> – just pull the

                        could <hi rend="double">strip</hi> as fast as a man, and put the ribbon
                            bands about the cigars

                    <p>At 12:15 o'clock I went into the shop and was given a chair in front of a barrel filled with inches of tobacco called <hi rend="double">hands</hi> and lined with gunny-cloth.

                            leaves were stripped and laid on the board it
                        was thubbed a <hi rend="double">book-filler</hi> and carried off to the next room. In the shop
                        with this were some eighteen men or more rolling the <hi rend="double">fillers</hi>, putting on
                        the wrappers, shaping the cigars with a broad

                            girls, while not really
                        harmful, could hardly be called beneficial. I stripped leaves enough to enable me to take the social

                            girl who wore mourning. She
                        had brought back a dozen chemises for which the house paid $2, but the work was soiled in the making-machine oil having

                            $2 some
                        $4 and some
                        $1.70 but most of them only pay 20 cents. Everything is done by machine including button holes and gussets. The bosoms and bands are ready to go in. Corset-covers pay 40 cents and 20 cents each, but they have to be trimmed and the holes worked by hand. This is a mean shop, so far as prices go, but they
                        are all alike in that particular. <seg>You have to find <phr><w type="poss" ana="#employee">your</w> own <w type="noun">thread</w></phr> and you are constantly being suspected of keeping
                        back short ends of trimmings.</seg></p>
                    <p>I asked the forewoman for stitching and was given shirts at 80 cents a dozen to do. I had to pay 50
                            cents for the use of the machine
                        and 25 cents for a spindle of thread. <seg>I told the forewoman I had left <phr><w type="poss" ana="#nellNelson">my</w>
                            <w type="noun">purse</w></phr> at home, but she said
                        it was <said who="#foreperson" ana="female">alright you can have it taken
                            out of <phr><w type="poss" ana="#nellNelson">your</w> <w type="noun">wages</w></phr>.</said></seg> I asked her what the machine cost, but she doesn't know, and when I ventured
                        that the expiration of the patient had
                        reduced the old place
                        $15 to about $12 she told me she
                            <said who="#foreperson" ana="female">reckoned I didn't know what I was
                            talking about.</said> The room where we worked was
                        about eighteen feet wide and ten feet
                        deep with toilet closets built out from the walls. The machines encircled the
                        three walls and in the middle of the
                            floor were the boxes of work. One girl was
                        stitching wrist-bands, another had button-hole machine and was getting 50 cents a hundred. A third
                        was making tucked drawers at 20 cents
                        a dozen and I had a shirt at 60 cents which I failed to finish all three hours, being unable to manage a machine.</p>
