Both buildings have three stories, each containing a shop under a different <hi rend="double">boss</hi>. I followed the crowd through both buildings beginning in the basement and going up and up and up the narrow, dirty, covered stairs, stopping on each floor to see the <hi rend="double">boss</hi> and apply for work. No success. The vest shops were full and so were the trousers shops. In the jacket shop there was room for experienced hands only at the munificent salary of $3 a week. The garments were cut and the sewer had the entire making.</p><p>As I passed through the crowded rooms I could not help noticing the machine-like way in which everything was done. Not a moment was wasted in greetings or exchange of friendly remarks. <seg>Almost at the very instant the girls took <phr><w type="poss" ana="#workingGirl">their</w> <w type="noun">seats</w></phr> the machines were whizzing and whirling and the bright little needles flying through seams, collars, bands, and facings.</seg> <seg>Cutters clicked <phr><w type="poss" ana="#workingGirl">their</w> <w type="noun">shears</w> and little <w type="noun">scissors</w></phr> and pressers sponged leg-seams and collars and moved <phr><w type="poss" ana="#workingGirl">their</w> heavy <hi rend="double"><w type="noun">gooses</w></hi></phr> under little clouds of steaming vapor.</seg> Everywhere it was work, work, work, for barely enough to keep life in the body and virtue in the soul of these hapless children of misery.</p><p>The only real misery about these two great shops, containing in all about <damage agent="fold" unit="word" quantity="1"/><unclear><supplied resp="#ras">seven</supplied></unclear> work-rooms and five hundred workers, was the wealth of sunlight and fresh air. On three sides of the buildings were windows through which the heavens smiled. The staircases, which, by the way, were boxed, ran aling the right side of the building, and which, in case of fire, whould have gone up in an instant, leaving the unfortunate inmates with absolutely no means of escape but the windows. <seg>I asked one of the <hi rend="double">bosses</hi> where <phr><w type="poss" ana="#employer">his</w> <w type="noun">fire-escape</w></phr> was</seg>, and he told me if I has no other business with him to <said who="#employer" ana="male">get out.</said></p><p>All the women and girls I talked with lived at home. I was informed that only those living in the neighborhood were engaged, thus doing away with the car-fare item. Some of the little girls were paid $1 a week for tacking on tickets, sewing on buckles to backstraps, and pulling out basting stitches. All other work was paid for by the piece and salaries varying from $2 to $10, according to the skill of the laborer. $4 being a fair average for this season of the year. The worst feature of these shops was the limited room. The girls sat elbow to elbow and the floor was piled with work half an hour after the shop opened.</p><p><seg>At 8 o'clock I went to <orgName type="exposedCompany" ref="#Benson"><phr><w type="poss" ana="#Benson">Benson's</w> <w type="noun" ana="#Benson">shop</w></phr></orgName> at <placeName type="address" ref="#Benson">Hobbie and Chatham streets</placeName> where some evidences of decency were apparent.</seg> Instead of the rude timber generally put in work tables I found those on the main floor planed and grained. Off the shop was a cozy little office, and printed in three different languages were framed copies of rules and regulations. Quoting from the set, the employes were notified that the hours of work were from 7 to 12 and from 1 to 6; any one desiring to leave before would require a permit to do so from the office; <seg>any one neglecting to give the firm a <phr>three <w type="poss">days'</w> <w type="noun">notice</w></phr> prior to leaving would forfeit any salary due</seg>; <seg>every operator was obliged to oil and clean <phr><w type="poss" ana="#workingGirl">her</w> <w type="noun">machine</w></phr> in the morning before using and in the evening after using it</seg>.</p><p>The prices paid were miserably low. A couple of girls who <hi rend="double">tacked</hi> pockets recieved 80 cents a hundred, and work was kept back so that often the earnings did not exceed $2 a week. Once or twice $18 was recieved in two weeks. Girls who did the <hi rend="double">flesh</hi> basting along the leg seams of pants were paid $1 a hundred; 7 cents was the price paid for finishing the cheaper vests and 9 cents the better ones. Here I met white-haired women who sewed from morning till night to make $5 a week.</p><p>The <hi rend="double">boss</hi> didn't need any help, so I tried the retail tailor store of <orgName type="exposedCompany" ref="#KNels">Knute Nelson</orgName>, <placeName type="address" ref="#KNels">113 Chicago avenue</placeName>.</p><p><said who="#employer" ana="male">Business is dull and we are not doing much up-stairs. You might come in next week if you are idle, but I'll tell you now that you can't earn over 50 cents a day. We are working on vests; make them all by machine. If you can sew well I'll give you 1 cent for joining the collar.</said></p><p>Telling him he would do nothing of the kind I put into <placeName type="address" ref="#Schmidt">Cleveland avenue</placeName> and came upon the genuine slop-shop. At <placeName type="address" ref="#Schmidt">No. 314</placeName> I met <orgName type="exposedCompany" ref="#Schmidt"><persName ref="#employer">Mrs. Schmidt</persName></orgName>. The family lives up-stairs in a cottage and on the ground floor is the shop, which is entered from the back yard via the kitchen.</p><p>In the latter apartment was a splendid, big range, brightly polished. A couple of Sweded were pressing at a side table. <seg>In the front room were the machine girls, nice, healthy creatures, selected no doubt for <phr><w type="poss" ana="#workingGirl">their</w> enduring <w type="noun">quality</w></phr>.</seg> Nothing but the boards in the floor protected the place from the damp soil, and while everything was scrupulously neat the facilities for rheumatism were largely superior to those for health, comfort, and light. Wages varied. <seg><persName ref="#employer">Mr Schmidt</persName> was away but <phr><w type="poss" ana="#employer">his</w> <w type="noun">salary sheet</w></phr> was safe in <phr><w type="poss" ana="#employer">his</w> <w type="noun">wife</w>'s keeping</phr>. <said who="#employer" ana="female">Some girls care so much and some not so much, and that's how it is,</said> she said. One of <phr><w type="poss" ana="#employer">her</w> oldest <w type="noun" ana="#workingGirl">hands</w></phr> told me she worked <said who="#workingGirl" ana="female">like a slave for $4.50 and never get more than $5. He won't let you.</said></seg></p><p><persName ref="#employer">Mr. Huber</persName> of <placeName type="address" ref="#Huber">335 Cleveland avenue</placeName> has not mastered the English language, but knows all about the values of American labor, since he gets it as low as $1 a week.</p><p><seg><phr><w type="poss" ana="#employer">His</w> <w type="noun" ana="#Huber">establishment</w></phr> is in a rear building adjoining <phr><w type="poss" ana="#employer">his</w> <w type="noun">residence</w></phr>.</seg> Ascending a flight of wooden stairs I found myself on a landing, from which one door led to the Huber kitchen and another down four steps to the shop. The sewers numbered possibly thirty, in all stages of poverty. The worked as though salvation depended on industry, and all the time I remained not a word was spoken. The girls made signs when a spool of thread or a skein of twist was wanted. From every window a different house was visible, some of them, being nothing more than sheds, in all of which were young children and mothers.</p><p><seg><persName ref="#employer">Huber</persName> didn't want any more help. I sought him through <phr><w type="poss" ana="#employer">his</w> <w type="noun">wife</w></phr>, but found him so sullen out of pity for her I took an early dismissal.</seg> <seg>It made me very unhappy to see the poor girls slaving over <phr><w type="poss" ana="#workingGirl">their</w> <w type="noun">work</w></phr>, ruining <phr><w type="poss" ana="#workingGirl">their</w> <w type="noun">eyes</w></phr>, health, and appearance by the faulty positions in which they sat.</seg> It needed no quizzing to learn that the salaries recieved were poor, for there was not a decent pair of shoes nor a tidy dress in the whole assembly.</p><p>In the rear of <placeName type="address" ref="#Klein">323 Cleaveland avenue</placeName> is a two-story wood shed, on the upper floor of which <persName ref="#employer">Herr Klein</persName> and a half a hundred employes work on <hi rend="double">shop</hi> clothing and make money. That is, <persName ref="#employer">Klein</persName> makes it. At the foot of the stairs leading from the back-yard is a little kennel, from which a ferocious watch-dog bounded and scared me into a fit. The <hi rend="double">boss</hi> was <said who="#foreperson" ana="male">out on the front sidewalk</said> the foreman told me. He offered to call him, but I protested and, seating myself on the edge of a press-stand, surveyed the room. Gorls all around sewing with slavish speed and convict silence. Everything silent as the tomb but the trembling machines. <seg>Girls in calico rags and woolen rags and one with a neat little 3-cent cotton suit and a pink ribbon about <phr><w type="poss" ana="#workingGirl">her</w> <w type="noun">neck</w></phr>.</seg> A child of a dozen years or so goes round the room with drinking-water. The four men wear slippers and clay pipes and press without ceasing the cheap John and cottony pants and vests. <seg>All the windows are wide open and at the very level of <phr><w type="poss">their</w> <w type="noun">sills</w></phr> I count the roofs of seven foul-smelling closets.</seg></p><p><persName ref="#employer">Klein</persName> is middle-aged, with a complexion like pork tenderloin and a limited knowledge of English. <seg>He manages to make me understand that I have no show, and I make <phr><w type="poss" ana="#nellNelson">my</w> <w type="noun">farewell appearance</w></phr> and open at <orgName type="exposedCompany" ref="#Schmall">Schmallen's</orgName> <placeName type="address" ref="#Schmall">138 Mohawk street</placeName>.</seg> <seg>That gentleman uses <phr><w type="poss" ana="#employer">his</w> <w type="noun" ana="#employer">wife</w></phr> for a mouthpiece and <phr><w type="poss" ana="#employer">his</w> <w type="noun">kitchen</w></phr> for a factory.</seg> Only three girls are at work. Rest laid off till next week. They have pantaloons for the millions about the room, stacked in piles of five feet high, for finishing which girls get 6 cents or 30 cents a day.</p><p>At <placeName type="locRef">26 Eugenie street</placeName> I find another shop in which the girls are packed like cattle in a freight car. The <hi rend="double">boss</hi> doesn't want to try me and I'm glad of it.</p><p>I take a walk down <placeName type="locRef">Larrabee street</placeName>. At <orgName type="exposedCompany" ref="#Oleson"><choice><sic>Olson</sic><reg>Oleson</reg></choice>'s</orgName>, on <placeName type="address" ref="#Oleson">Sedgwick street near Superior</placeName>, I am <hi rend="double">taken</hi>. It is just 12 o'clock. I have been tramping through <placeName type="locRef">Little Hell</placeName> and vicinity since 7 o'clock and feel complately <hi rend="double">done</hi>. I take a rest till 12:30 and explore the shop. The building is a story and a half, extending back to the alley, with a frontage of forty feet. In the basement is a livery stable. <persName ref="#employer">Mr. Olsen</persName> keeps three or more steeds here and rents out a stall or two to a neighbor. Off the stable is a closet for the hands On the floor above the stables are quarters for twenty odd men ans women in a dirty, dark, gloomy place, with bare rafters and smoke-stained, unfinished walls. The machine-tables are set along the window line, leaving the center of the floor for a blazing furnace that supplies the power and mountains of pants ready to be finished. Near the roaring fire is a sink supplied with nothing but a faucet. <seg>When it was time to go home <phr><w type="poss" ana="#nellNelson">my</w> <w type="noun">face</w></phr> and hands were coated with dust and dye, but there was neither soap nor towel with which to make myself decent and I had to go unwashed.</seg> The upper floor had a slanting roof in which windows were cut to admit the necessary although by no means sufficient light. The heat was simply enfeebling. <seg>Before I had half started <phr><w type="poss" ana="#nellNelson">my</w> <w type="noun">No. 33</w></phr> I was inclined to throw down the gauntlet and go home, but the patient, uncomplaining, suffering girls made me ashamed of myself and I resolved to hold on.</seg> <seg>The perspiration rolled down <phr><w type="poss" ana="#workingGirl">their</w> <w type="noun">arms</w> and <w type="noun">faces</w></phr> and stained the miserable waists they wore at the neck and shoulders.</seg></p><p><seg><said who="#workingGirl" ana="female">Yes, it's awful hot up here</said>, <phr><w type="poss" ana="#nellNelson">my</w> <w type="noun" ana="#workingGirl">neighbor</w></phr> remarked</seg> <said who="#workingGirl" ana="female">but this is nothing to the cold. <seg>In the winter we work with our cloaks on always till noon, and lots of times I have kept <phr><w type="poss" ana="#workingGirl">my</w> <w type="noun">overshoes</w></phr> on all day.</seg></said></p><p><seg>The <hi rend="double">boss</hi> made me equivocate about <phr><w type="poss" ana="#nellNelson">my</w> <w type="noun">knowledge</w></phr> of the pantaloon trade.</seg></p><p><said who="#employer" ana="male">I can't take any but experienced help.</said></p><p><said who="#nellNelson" ana="female">How much?</said></p><p><said who="#employer" ana="male">Where have you worked?</said></p><p><said who="#nellNelson" ana="female">Oh, at <orgName type="exposedCompany" ref="#Goldsmith">Goldsmith's</orgName> and <orgName type="exposedCompany" ref="#Stein">Julius Stein's</orgName> and <orgName type="exposedCompany" ref="#Ellinger">Ellinger's</orgName> and--</said></p><p><said who="#employer" ana="male">Have you done tailoring?</said></p><p><said who="#nellNelson" ana="female">Plenty.</said></p><p><said who="#employer" ana="male">Well, then, if you're experienced you ought to be worth considerable: Here, take that for a sample,</said> and he handed me a pair of No. 33 striped pantaloons with a roll of red and white waistbands and sent me up-stairs, where, between the stable smell and the evervating atmosphere, I became near collapsing.</p><p>I hadn't the faintest idea of how to go about the waist of the garment, but I watched the <hi rend="double">boss</hi> down-stairs and got <persName ref="#employee">Matson</persName> to let me sit by him. T<seg>he dear man was bald and untidy, but he basted in the body lining for me, chalked the buttons on the waistband and fly, and did <phr><w type="poss" ana="#nellNelson">my</w> <w type="noun">ripping</w></phr>--which was not trifling.</seg> It was 12:30 o'clock when I began, and I worked every moment of the time with a diligence that was positively criminal till the work was done. <seg>It was 4:45 o'clock when I handed <phr><w type="poss" ana="#nellNelson">my</w> first <w type="noun">pair</w> of factory trousers</phr> to the <hi rend="double">boss</hi>, who looked them over from bottoms to buttons, and said: <said who="#employer" ana="male">You'll do the others better.</said></seg></p><p><said who="#nellNelson" ana="female">Yes, sir.
