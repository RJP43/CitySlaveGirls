I wanted for a big, lusty packer to finish pummelling the mischievious little Swede who ran the elevator and was carried up to the top floor with a box of cloth. When the car landed I found myself at the extreme end of a room 50x180 feet, in an inclosure of wire-fence, packing-boxes, and cutting-boards&#8212;beyond and between which I could see perhaps two hundred persons, mostly women, bent over machines, and working as only slaves ever work. <seg>The thundering noise made by the machinery deadened every other sound, even that made by the cutters as they ran <phr><w type="poss">their</w> heavy <w type="noun">shears</w></phr> through the satin and muslin trimmings.</seg> <seg>Sixteen persons passed me&#8212;men in undershirts, trousers, and slippers, with work in <phr><w type="poss" ana="#employee">their</w> <w type="noun">hands</w></phr>; men in business suits, with work in <phr><w type="poss" ana="#employee">their</w> <w type="noun">brains</w></phr>; girls of 13 in rags and death-like pallor, with work in <phr><w type="poss" ana="#workingGirl">their</w> <w type="noun">arms</w></phr>; older and paler girls and still older and paler women, some with white hair and spectacles, carrying work to be pressed, examined, altered, or checked.</seg> Nobody noticing me, I asked a pretty little girl who was cutting a bolt of satin into cuff-lining to direct me to the forewoman and was told to go and sit down till she came. <seg>I had hardly arranged myself on an empty box when a playful young man capsized <phr><w type="poss" ana="#nellNelson">my</w> <w type="noun">throne</w></phr> and spilled me in a heap of unmade cloaks.</seg> <seg><phr><w type="poss" ana="#nellNelson">My</w> first <w type="noun">impulse</w></phr> was for revenge, but remembering that I was a poor girl looking for work I contented myself by betting <phr><w type="poss" ana="#nellNelson">my</w> damaged left <w type="noun">knee</w> and right <w type="noun">elbow</w></phr>.</seg> <seg>While mentally photographing the miserable, little, bullet-headed sappling who caused <phr><w type="poss" ana="#nellNelson">my</w> <w type="noun" subtype="refTo" ana="#employee">trouble</w></phr>, a young woman brought me a chair and placed it in a corner, which convenient spot happened to be off a narrow passage leading to the work-room proper.</seg> <seg><phr><w type="poss" ana="#nellNelson">My</w> <w type="noun">nose</w></phr> was not long in the scenting a row of closets that alled the south side of the passageway.</seg> Overhead was a pasteboard sign with <hi rend="double">No admission to the work-room</hi> printed in large, black letters.

To escape being knocked in the head by a two-story press-board I clutched a little stitcher who said: <said who="#workingGirl" ana="female">You an't sick, is you?</said></p><p>I guessed I was. Bringing me a tin cup-full of water, she departed, saying: <said who="#workingGirl" ana="female">She'd be docked if she didn't go.</said></p><p>An old man with grey hair and glasses showed me to the freight elevator and I was let down to the second story.
