                The Restoration of Nell Nelson Project began as an in-depth capstone paper and presentation for completion of a History based Social Science Bachelor’s degree. During the beginning stages of research it became apparent that the “City Slave Girls” series lacked any representation in history and more generally any collective digital representation. Then, using the research and sources from which the history capstone was built, the project took a turn into digital humanities scholarship. In the spring of 2014 the first transcriptions were made of some of the original articles. The transcriptions were developed from PDF files of poorly photographed images of the newspaper series (which is why this is a section of the project that is still being developed). In the summer of 2014 contact was made with Harvard University’s Digital Library in order to receive the McEnnis text. Harvard provided an OCR version of that original text; therefore, in the fall of 2014 the initial work on the project included the use of regular expressions to clean up some of the OCR mistakes in order to produce a clean, plain text. Then in the fall of 2014 editors developed a complex RelaxNG schema that provides a systematic way to code all three sources. With the schema in place we used XML to markup 4 original articles and 3 corresponding chapters of the McEnnis text. Using those initial exploratory  XML documents inside of an XQuery database we were able to notice trends in representations of the voice element (personae and connotation voiced) between the two versions. The conclusion was that the book significantly reduced Nelson’s witty remarks and inverted the sexual innuendo of the  male personae (the foremen and owners of the industries Nelson was exposing) so that it appeared as if  advancements were being made on behalf of the female personae (the working women). This shocking revelation developed into a data visualization using the information pulled from the XQuery database and graphed using SVG. Then once the project entered stages of website development, also in the fall of 2014,  we wrote JavaScript to enhance user interface with the SVG graph. Throughout the following year, leading to now (Fall 2015), work has continued on the transcription of articles and the XML coding of both articles and the McEnnis chapters. We are currently in the beginning stages of  developing a map from Chicago in 1888 that would have all of the companies and places named from the original articles plotted with descriptions. A key component of Nelson’s original articles was that she provided exact addresses and descriptions of the companies she was exposing. A map representation would highlight Nelson’s bold statement of listing full company names and addresses; a statement extinguished in both book versions.  The project continues to undergo website development in regards to website aesthetics adjusting the CSS and developing XSLT style sheets that will transform the XML files into HTML. </p>
               <p> As The Restoration of Nell Nelson project continues into its second year of website progression and third year of in-depth research/investigation new questions for future scholarship also are developing. Students of the University of Pittsburgh at Greensburg Digital Humanities course in the fall of 2015 have shown interest in making further visual analysis of the versioning between texts. Once the archival aspects of the project are complete and the entirety of all the sources are available there will be many opportunities for more research questions to develop. With each new research question there is prospect for increased data visualizations and more in depth conclusions.  As this project grows the editors would like the opportunity to work with the original copies of the newspaper articles. Before completion of the archived material there is hope to re-photograph the articles and render better images of them to display on site alongside the transcriptions.  The transfer from the project-specific, RelaxNG schema to working under the TEI is a large step the project is currently taking in order to expand the utility and value of the project  within existing  digital humanities’ scholarship</p>
