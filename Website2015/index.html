                This website is designed with the intention to restore Nell Nelson’s instrumental work in exposing the cruel and unsanitary working conditions of Chicago’s manufacturing industry of the late nineteenth century. Nelson’s series, “City Slave Girls,” was published in The Chicago Daily Times in late-July, 1888. Nelson was a pioneer of investigative reporting and provided ground-breaking work in Chicago. The series completely exposed the mistreatment of the women and children that worked in Chicago’s manufacturing industries.
