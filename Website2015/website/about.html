            <h2>Project Development</h2>
            <p>This project seeks to restore Nell Nelson’s instrumental work in exposing the cruel and unsanitary working conditions of Chicago’s manufacturing industry of the late nineteenth century. Nelson’s series, “City Slave Girls,” was published in The Chicago Daily Times in late July, 1888. Nelson was a pioneer of investigative reporting and provided ground-breaking work in Chicago. The series exposed the mistreatment of the women and children that worked in Chicago’s manufacturing industries.</p>
            <p>The success of her series is a bewilderment considering the extensive inversion of social norms represented in the writing of her exposé. The “City Slave Girls” series put into question the practices of the most prestigious men of Chicago; yet, Nell Nelson was a woman unable to even vote due to the gender restraints of her time. Through her satirical and witty writing, Nelson beat the adversity of being a female news reporter and the publication of the series gained attention from Chicago’s political representatives along with the owners of the very industries she scrutinized.  Although the significance of the series was recognized at the time of publication and for some time after, Nelson’s role in exposing the hardships of the “City Slave Girls” lacks any proper representation in all realms of history. The “City Slave Girls” series is a monumental resource of information for women’s history, labor history, and the history of undercover journalism.</p>
            <p>There are three main facets of this project. First and foremost The Restoration of Nell Nelson requires a complete digitization of the three sources where Nelson’s “City Slave Girls” series were published: the originals from the Chicago Daily Times, a published book version (abridged and currently accessible to this project only on microfilm ), and The White Slaves of Free America by John T. McEnnis (large snippets of the articles within the context of this pro-unionization book with OCR text available courtesy of Harvard University’s Digital Library). Each of the sources provide their own hurdles in obtaining code-ready, plain text. This is the most important aspect of the project because there is currently no complete archive of this series digitally available in searchable text. The second facet of the project is the selecting of a logical tag set developed within the TEI guidelines that will govern the markup of all three sources. Finally this project intends to provide data visualizations and conclusions to research questions of related importance to the series. </p>
            
            <h3>Year 2</h3>
            <p>This semester, the major focus was on overhauling the code behind the articles. We worked to establish a system consistent with the Text Encoding Initiative that was as objective as possible. When evaluating our code, we considered three major ideas: the quantitative measure of dialogue dependent on gender and the working girl, the relationship between possesive adjectives and their corresponding nouns, and Nell's distinct pool of vocabulary within her articles. We also changed the CSS, added SSI's, and established a schematron. Along with these changes, we found a second home at <a href="http://newtfire.org">Newtfire</a> within the <a href="http://www.psc.edu">Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center</a></p>
            <p>Our first step was bringing our system of coding in line with the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI). This was a major task; in working with the prior set of code, we found that nearly every element needed to be replaced or renamed. On top of that, the initial markup was inherently subjective by design. The prior code was intented to mark up points of connotation (such as sexual, sarcastic, positive, or negative). As a group, we discovered significant inconsistency in the interpretation of text from coder to coder. When dealing with a single example, what one person considered sarcastic, another considered sexual. This also posed the question of how much of the text needs to be wrapped. If a whole paragraph is sarcastic, should all of the sentences be wrapped? What if just one word seemed sarcastic? Our initial concept was to map these inconsistencies between coders. We thought that this, too would cause a issue with time, forcing every indiviual within the project to read and mark up each article. After spending time bringing this inconsistent set of tags into the TEI, we made the ultimate decision to change the focus of our system. In doing so, we removed all tags representing connotations.</p>
            <p>The elements that we did keep were mostly structural ones, and also ones focusing on dialogue: p (representing paragraphs), said @who @ana (representing quoted speech; @who represents the speaker; @ana represents the gender of the speaker), rs @type=interruption (representing narration between a single quote), placeName @type (for any reference to a place; @type including address, locRef, country, state, or city), persName (for names), and orgName @ref (for references to companies that Nell was exposing; @ref being a reference for the exposed companies). For all of the different people and speakers within the articles, we created a list of 'archetypes': nelNelson, workingGirl, foreperson, employer, employee, benefactor, messenger, and unidentified. We also created TEI headers for all articles, which includes bibliographical information, attribution for transcription and coding, and more.</p>
            <p>The first major research question developed out of these simple tags: if Nell's interntion was to unveil the plight of the 'city slave girls,' whose voice does she give the most dialogue to? We were interested in evaluating the quantity of dialogue between males and females, as well as Nell Nelson herself and women directly labeled as working girls. We prduced a bar graph comparing the amount of speech from each speaker between each article. We also implemented these tags into javascript and css of the articles themselves. When viewing the articles on our website, a clickable box appears on the page, allowing viewers to toggle a colored border around the different types of dialogue, dependent on the speaker.</p>
            <p>Our next goal was to consider a more objective way to mark up Nelson's articles. Thanks to a suggestion from Prof. Greg Bondar, we began marking up gammatical elements. We decided to begin with both nouns and adjectives. This alone proved to be an immensely time-consuming task. This also proved to be quite complicated as well; Each team member had to be instructed on the parts of speech. At times, nouns can act as adjectives (clothing factory). Other times, while we decided not to tag pronouns (he, she, it, etc.), we decided to tag posessive pronouns (my purse, his watch, their employees) and include an attribute to hold who or what it was referring to (using our set of 'archetypes'). This is the tagging system: w @type @subtype @ana. 'w' represents both nouns and adjectives, defined by @type. @ana was used for the stem of the word for an adjective (laziest: type='adj' ana='lazy'), or it would be used as the 'archetype' of a noun if applicable (seamstress type='noun' ana='#workingGirl'). @subtype was used for adjectives that were possessive, and the @ana would then be the 'archetype' (his type='adj' subtype='poss' ana='#employer'). In order to keep adjectives tied with the nouns that they were modifying, the words were wrapped in element 'seg'.</p>
            <p>However, even this system  required us to make some concessions with our system. The most prominent issue is the use of our 'seg' element to bind nouns and adjectives. One adjective is fine (lazy worker). Nouns with two or more adjectives also work with this system, as long as all of the adjectives are modifying the same noun (dumb lazy incompetent worker). Things become complicated when a noun is being modified by an adjective that is being modified by a third adjective. Here is an example of a considerably complex issue: 'pine board three feet long and sixteen inches wide'. Here, the base noun is board. Pine is a simple adjective modifying board. The issue comes when we consider the other modifiers: three feet long is mean to define the length of the board, but it is not easy to convey this through tags. 'Three' modifies 'feet', which modifies 'long', which modifies 'board'. 'Long' can be marked as an adjective that modifies 'board', but that implies that the board itself is long (which is not the correct implication). Labeling 'three' as an adjective is correct, but with our system, it would seem that it is instead modifying 'board'. Ultimately, because we did not want to become tangled in 'seg' elements, the decision was made to 'ignore' these instances (three feet long @type='adj' @ana='long'). While still disingenuous, with the precise measurement and unit simply ignored, the idea that the property of length is discussed remains intact.</p>
            <p>This example also brings up the issue of units as adjectives: times, dates, ages, numerals, and prices. We created a system of rules to attribute for each case. For numerals of quantity or age, the @ana would be the number represented as a digit (thirty five @type='adj' @ana='35'). Dates, such as July 13th or thirteenth, are ignored. Price and monetary values are defined as such: for either $5 or or $5.00 or five dollars: the number is represented as the attribute, like quantity. The noun is either the word or symbol for dollar. Decimal values are alllowed only if the original number inclues them ($1.23 @ana='1.23'; $5.60 @ana='5.6'). The number is never converted to another value and is dependent on the unit that Nellson uses within the article; for example, cents should never be converted into dollars by the coder (63 cents is represented differently than $0.63). For time, instances like 6:00 and 6 o'clock are ignored; however, 6 hours past noon would be represented as such: the 'seg' around 6 hours, with 6 as the adjective and hours as the noun. Noon is tagged outside of that 'seg', as its own individual 'w' element.</p>
            <p>With these rules and tagging system established, we created two more sets of data visualization. The first is a table, pulling all of the nouns and adjectives inside of the 'seg' elements together. This is to display visually the interesting choice of language that Nelson makes with her descriptions. The next set of data visualization is a table representing possessive nouns and pronouns and the nouns that are associated with them. Using our system of 'archetypes', we can see who or what these nouns are being associated with.</p>
            
            <h3>Year 1</h3>            
            <p>One of the beginning research questions posed was what kind of information was altered and excluded. Why if all of the sources were published within the same year (1888) do both of the book versions exclude important aspects used by Nelson in the original newspaper series detailing the corruption.  The analysis of the texts began questioning: what was left out and/or changed? How did the book publications provide a different variation to Nelson’s clearly disgusted image portrayed in the original Chicago Daily Times publication? In the fall of 2014 a co-editor of the project, Shane Daube, showed interest in representing the connotation of the three main character types within the series: the male personae, the female personae, and Nelson. He wanted to compare (using the <a href="https://github.com/RJP43/CitySlaveGirls-ChicagoDailyTimes1888/tree/master/ChicagoTimes_CSG_PDFandOldXML/2014articleMarkup">minimally transcribed data</a> in development) the three different voices and the variation of voice connotations within the original articles versus the article parts in The White Slaves of Free America.  Using XQuery and SVG Shane developed a graph visualization that provided interesting conclusions in regard to the extreme alterations made between versions.  He provided variation data that otherwise would only have been derived and made obvious after close reading of both sources.</p>
            
            <h3>Future Development of Scholarship</h3>
            <p>As The Restoration of Nell Nelson project continues into its second year of website progression and third year of in-depth research/investigation new questions for future scholarship also are developing. Students of the University of Pittsburgh at Greensburg Digital Humanities course in the fall of 2015 have shown interest in making further visual analysis of the versioning between texts. Once the archival aspects of the project are complete and the entirety of all the sources are available there will be many opportunities for more research questions to develop. With each new research question there is prospect for increased data visualizations and more in depth conclusions.  As this project grows the editors would like the opportunity to work with the original copies of the newspaper articles. Before completion of the archived material there is hope to re-photograph the articles and render better images of them to display on site alongside the transcriptions.  The transfer from the project-specific, RelaxNG schema to working under the TEI is a large step the project is currently taking in order to expand the utility and value of the project  within existing  digital humanities’ scholarship

            <h2>Background Information</h2>
            <p><b>Nell Nelson:</b> Helen Cusack-Carvalho used the pseudonym Nell Nelson when she wrote the "City Slave Girls" series in 1888. She was employed by the <i>Chicago Daily Times</i> and then later, following the success of her series in Chicago, hired by New York's <i>The World</i>. The biographical information on Helen Cusack-Carvalho is considerably illusive and currently anything remotely close to a complete biography of her is nonexistent. The primary source of biographical information comes from a <a href="http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/17511341211188655">journal article by Eric W. Liguori published in 2012</a>. In this article, Liguori alludes that Helen was born into the middle-class and that her career as a journalist allowed for her to maintain this status. Liguori reports that Helen married above her social class to a man named Solomon Solis Carvalho in 1895. After marriage, Helen's journalism career ceased to exist and she lived the remainder of her life raising their two daughters. According to an obituary found in a 1945 <i>New York Times</i>' publication Helen died in New Jersey. The obituary lacks any special recognition of her investigative series despite the popularity and influential effects it had on the labor reforms of the late nineteenth century.</p>
            <p><b>“City Slave Girls” Exposé:</b> The "City Slave Girls" series ran daily on the front-page of <i>The Chicago Daily Times</i>. The first article was published on July 30th, 1888 and the concluding article was published on September 3rd, 1888.  Helen Cusack-Carvalho posed as Nell Nelson, a poor female working girl. She reported in-depth on the living conditions, wages, and work environments associated with nineteenth century industialization. The early publication of the series places 'Nelson' as a pioneer of investigative reporting. 'Nelson' provided ground-breaking work in exposing the mistreatment of the women and children that worked in Chicago’s manufacturing industries. The success of her series is a bewilderment considering the extensive inversion of social norms represented in the writing of her exposé. The “City Slave Girls” series put into question the practices of the most prestigious men of Chicago; yet, 'Nell Nelson' was a woman unable to even vote due to the gender restraints of her time. Through her satirical and witty writing, 'Nelson' beat the adversity of being a woman in the nineteenth century and the publication of the series gained attention from Chicago’s political representatives along with the owners of the very industries she scrutinized.  After the intial publication of the series, two books were printed within the same year recognizing 'Nelson' and her investigative  work. In addition to the two books, Nelson was hired by <i>The World</i> to reproduce a similar series in New York. Although the significance of the series was recognized at the time of publication and for some time after, Nelson’s role in exposing the hardships of the “City Slave Girls” lacks any proper representation in history as of today. The “City Slave Girl” series should be a monumental resource of information for women’s history, labor history, and the history of undercover journalism.</p>
