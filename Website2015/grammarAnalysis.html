        <p>The following series of tables is a visualization of the nouns used per article with their associated adjectives and possessive pronouns. We tagged all nouns and pronouns with the element 'w', with @type specifying if the word was being used a noun or adjective. For nouns, @ana was used if the word was directly linked to one of our character archetypes (Nell Nelson, working girl, foreperson, employer, employee, benefactor, messenger, or unidentified). For adjectives, @ana was used to label the 'stem' of the word (example: lazy, lazier, and laziest all have the same @ana='lazy'). For possessive pronouns, @subtype='poss' was added. In this case, @ana represents the character archetype taking posession. The nouns, adjectives, and possessive pronouns were linked with the element 'seg'.</p>
        <p>Our purpose behind this tagging was to exemplify Nell Nelson's distinct vocabulary. We asked, when exposing the plight of the working girl, what language do both Nelson and the people she interviewed use? For the possesive pronouns, what nouns are owned, and what (or who) is being owned?</p>
