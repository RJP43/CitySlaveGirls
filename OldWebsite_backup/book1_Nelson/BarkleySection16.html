            <p>Neckwear is the source of E. Brothers' wealth, at whose factory, Market
               street, cravats, slip-ties, dude ties flat scarfs, four-in-hands, and
               bow-knots, are turned out by the hundred gross every week. Thither I went to
               make ties and the acquaintance of the tie-makers. The insolent treatment I
               received at H. S. &amp; M. and S. L. &amp; Co.'s, though anticipated was not
               encountered at E's. I had taken the wrong entrance and the politeness of the
               men in the elevator and stock rooms was most refreshing. In the forewoman I
               found a slovenly pudgy spinster of negative beauty and address, not at all
               inclined to be affected by the woeful condition of her sex. She was
               reluctant about giving me work because it took so much time to teach a green
               hand. I told her that was not my hue, that I was dextrous with the needle,
               and an expe- rienced (?) cloak
               and coat maker.
            </p>
            
            <p>"Then why don't you work at one of the trades? Either pays better than
               neckties."
            </p>
            
            <p>Remembering the pittances I had received at some other places and how I had
               battled for them, I felt dubious about the truth of her assertion, but
               argued that my health had proved treacherous and the work too heavy for hot
               weather. I told her I was a "hustler," and would like to try a week or so
               till I learned the business.
            </p>
            
            <p>"A week? Well, you'll do well if you learn it in a year. But take off your
               hat and I'll let you have a scarf."
            </p>
            
            <p>In answer to my query regarding wages, I received the stereotyped answer of
               the august "forelady," viz., "different prices." With so much specification
               I began to make scarfs.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>The work-shop was the breeziest, airiest, roomiest place I had ever worked
               in, but far from attractive, being rude in finish and poorly lighted. About
               the east wall was a low gallery stocked with goods, and the opposite wall
               was used as a clothes-press by the one hundred or so girls. There were hats,
               jackets, shawls and cloaks, dress-skirts, basques, petticoats and corsets
               which the girls had divested themselves of as much for economy as comfort.
               There was no machine to strain the ear and make the head ache, and its
               absence was to me as soothing as the quiet calm of country life. Another
               remarkable feature was the cheerfulness that prevaded the shop. No restraint
               but duty was apparent. The girls chatted and laughed, gave and borrowed
               experiences and luxuriated in an occasional flight of laziness. Indeed, I
               could not but regret somewhat the freedom of speech, for I heard many things
               in the course of my afternoon's work that were far from wholesome. The girls
               at my table were mostly of Irish parentage and seemed to be responsible to
               no one superior in authority. They were a romantic set of young women with
               apparently no interest in life beyond a speedy marriage.
            </p>
            
            <p>Plans had been laid for a picnic the following evening in Douglas Park, and
               all the girls were going, each having invited a "feller." Various schemes
               were contrived for securing their favor. From what I gleaned picnicing is by
               no means uncommon among the "necters." On Sunday evening all the girls had
               been "to the parks" and during the week they had "gone walkin'." One girl
               was engaged. It was her last week and provoked some mad speculations of
               luxury and pleasure. The bride prospective expressed a weakness for cream
               puff and "skirts with lace on," in both of which extravagances she intended
               to indulge when she became a wife.
            </p>
            
            <p>Some of the girls told me they had been at school, having passed through the
               sixth grade, and were inclined to go to church, "only it's little you can
               make out of the church.  They get all they can out of you and
               don't care what becomes of you." They didn't read the newspapers, they told
               me, "because there's never anything for working-girls in them." Most of them
               shopped at the cheap stores, but confessed a total ignorance of fabrics and
               methods of economy. For instance, one girl with a complexion like a dried
               hazelnut was making herself a tan-colored satin that she paid forty-nine
               cents a yard for, and with which she intended to wear "a white felt hat
               trimmed with a wing and snow veil."
            </p>
            
            <p>The forewoman gave me a dozen blue silk scarfs and sent her assistant to
               instruct me. That young woman was a domineering individual with an
               experience of ten years and very pretty dimpled hands. She used her needle
               with considerably more grace than her nose, and there was a deal less of the
               velvety quality in her voice than her hands. I failed to probe her. She was
               curt in her answers, boorish in manner, and very economical in the knowledge
               she imparted. Twice she came to see my work and each time said : "It won't
               do; rip it out." The work paid fifty cents a dozen and I finished twelve and
               one-half cents worth by five o'clock. I had to do my own pressing and
               furnish my own thread and needle. The girls I interrogated earned from three
               to ten dollars a week, the latter after eight year's experience. Plenty of
               girls made seven dollars a week, but a constant changing of fashion
               prevented a higher average the year round, as it was necessary to learn the
               style before being able to turn out more than ten dozen a week. Take it all
               in all E. Brothers' was the most humane factory in which I had any
               experience.
