            <p>Another day in a shop â€” a shop where I get a blinding headache and a dime.
               The place of servitude is at Milwaukee avenue, and the proprietors are Mr.
               and Mrs. S. It is nine o'clock when I enter what seems to be a store. On the
               right  is a small office containing a desk and a mountain of
               cloaks. Two yards back is a long cutting-board at which the father, mother
               and son are chalking or cutting out cloth. The old man has the everlasting
               frosts on his head, and in the wife's hair is more silver than jet. The son
               is still in the morning of his manhood. His manner is arrogant, his tone
               harsh, and his treatment of an old Christain who has come in with a letter,
               presumably from his wife or daughter soliciting work, is painful to
               contemplate. I feel like a vagabond when Mrs. S. demands an explanation for
               my presence.
            </p>
            
            <p>"I was here yesterday and you told me I might come to work today," I ventured
               to remark.
            </p>
            
            <p>"Oh, yes. You was the one that looked on yesterday and asked all about the
               wages, hey?"
            </p>
            
            <p>This is overwhelming and I tremble internally, expecting every moment to be
               seized by my jersey collar and Phyche knot and thrown out in the car-track.
               I bite my lips to keep my knees from knocking.
            </p>
            
            <p>When she says "Well, you may come this way," I am thankful for my safety and
               follow. Half-way down the store is a partition some five feet high, hung on
               both sides with cloaks and jackets, braided sacques and Dutch dresses, which
               contrivance screens the girls on the opposite side from view. A short
               distance back is a perfect embankment of work, fringe and inner trimmings.
               Passing these two fortifications we came into the presence of the
               "sweaters," all but six of whom are running machines at a tremendous
               speed.
            </p>
            
            <p>"Girls! Girls!" exclaimed Mrs. S.</p>
            
            <p>Some of the little engines stop.</p>
            
            <p>"Girls! Girls!" she says again.</p>
            
            <p>They all stop. And so does my breathing.</p>
            
            <p>"This girl has come to work here," Mrs. S. continues. "I aint got no time to
               learn her. You all help her if you got time."
            </p>
            
            
            <p>With this unheard-of and unexpected introduction Mrs. S. leaves me. I find a
               dusty table near a dirty zinc to put my hat and ask for a machine.
            </p>
            
            <p>"Can you run a machine?" the head of the establishment asks.</p>
            
            <p>I tell her a falsehood which I defend by personally arguing that I can do
               anything that these untutored young foreigners can perform. Determined to
               try I drop into a chair before a big "Household," and agony begins. I
               endeavor to apply my knowledge of the Wheeler &amp; Wilson to the machine.
               Trouble follows. The wheel is not under the table and is not meant to turn
               forward. The thread breaks a dozen times in twenty-four minutes, the
               intervening time being spent in threading the needle, which, like an
               equestrianne, has a side seat. I hem and tuck rags to get the stitch. The
               bobbin gives out, and how to fill it again, thread the shuttle and lace the
               top cotton, gives me much trouble. A little German girl at my left throws an
               occasional hint of value to me. She has a frightful cold in her head which
               she frankly confesses she caught the night before in Wicker park. I offer to
               help her, agreeing to stitch all day if she will only tell me how to put the
               work together. It's a bargain. I bind the edges of the front, back and side
               gores, get the hood in shape, and stitch the pockets. Just as I am beginning
               to feel like a Household conqueror, Mrs. S. comes along and throws a bundled
               Dutch dress on my machine-table and tells me to make it. I protest that I
               had much rather help Annie, fearing I may not get the cloak right.
            </p>
            
            <p>"Just make it. When it aint right you rip it. That's the way we learn the
               girls."
            </p>
            
            <p>Of course the string and sleeves, cuffs, hood, pocket laps collar, fronts,
               side bodies, back gores, back straps, and three skirt breadths are spread
               out before me. I sieze a bunch of bias binding and I bind and rip and rip
               and bind till noon,  marveling all the time at the work that
               literally rolls out all about me. Poor Annie's eyes get red; so does her
               little nose; her face swells, her voice gets husky, and her handkerchief is
               as wet as a laundry. She has only made two garments working from seven to
               twelve. "I only made forty cents this morning," she said, "but it's this
               awful cold." I can make six when I work hard. I usually earn seven dollars a
               week. Sometimes it's more, but not often, and some times it's less. I must
               go home now."
            </p>
            
            <p>She folds up her work, covers her machine with her apron, has the two dresses
               entered in her book, and goes off to nurse her cold.
            </p>
            
            <p>A girl with a complexion like a peach and light blue eyes says she has been
               working four years. "I began at fourteen in Z's factory," she says. "There I
               got so I could make one dollar a day easily, but I had awful head aches and
               the doctor said I must only sew three days in the week. Then I went to the
               shop every other day for a year, but the pain didn't go and the doctor said
               it was the steam power and made me leave. Since I have worked by foot my
               head is all right. Yes, my parents are living and own a little cottage on
               Sedgwick street."
            </p>
            
            <p>The hand girls were all beginners. They were all ages from eleven to sixteen,
               earning one, two, and three dollars a week sewing on buttons, butting in
               bustles, and filling the inside linings. Most of them were Swedes and unable
               to speak a word of English. All the hands brought big lunches of bread,
               sausage, or ham, and fruit pancake. I was hungry enough to devour my worst
               enemy, and notwithstanding I interviewed a dozen or more of the diners not a
               morsel was offered me. There was an hour for noon, but most of the machines
               were thundering away at 12:30. The closets, two in number, were down in the
               cellar, and the foulness of the place was sickening. A kerosene lamp, hung
               four feet from  the floor partially lit the dark passage along
               which were coal-sheds and closets in suites for the several flats in the
               building.
            </p>
            
            <p>At 3 o'clock my cloak was not finished. I had pains in my head and back, my
               ankles ached, and my feet were scalded with heat and perspiration from the
               constant motion of the machine. No need of acting this time. I simply went
               to Mrs. S. and told her I had no dinner and was too faint to work another
               moment.
            </p>
            
            <p>"Didn't you have no lunch?" she asked. "Why didn't you tell me? I could have
               given you a cup of coffee."
            </p>
            
            <p>I thanked her for her good intention and asked to be paid. "Well, that Dutch
               dress is 20 cents. If you done half, you get half pay. That's right, ain't
               it? I tell you you can't make a living at this; It's too hard for a woman
               that ain't used to it. I would like to pay more, for when the girls make I
               make, don't you see?"
            </p>
            
            <p>For the sake of exit I acquiesced, took my dime and went out. At the door I
               met two little Polish children, Polly and Annie S., who told me they lived
               on George street, near Carpenter, and could not get work in the shop till
               they were "leven." Both had a basket of greasy, filthy victuals they had
               picked along the alleyways, and into Polly's hamper I dropped Mrs. S's
               bright dime for luck.
            </p>
            
            <p>Some day soon I shall use the money so kindly sent to the editor of The Times
               for a shop-girl's shoe and stocking party (and little Polly and her sister
               shall have a card.)
            </p>
            
            <p>You poor, dependent, neglected girl, who started out in real earnest, without
               education or training, to earn your own living, from the bottom of my heart
               I pity you. I have been thinking all day where I could send you for aid and
               instruction.
