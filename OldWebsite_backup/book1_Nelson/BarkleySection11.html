            <p>Wednesday morning I began my career as dry-goods clerk. It took all my wits
               to get an opening. At F's, M's, W's and S's no help was needed, and none
               would be taken without experience. By all managers I was treated politely.
               L. didn't want any more help and told me so with vehemence. The big blonde
               who manages the B. H. was "very sorry he could not offer me anything before
               the fall trade opened." I told him I was quick at figures and knew I could
               sell goods if I only had a chance. No, it was too late in the season and I
               had better come in again. I asked bow much he thought I would be worth. "Oh,
               $3.50 or $4 till you are experienced." "Couldn't you give me $5.
            </p>
            
            <p>"Hardly."</p>
            
            <p>"Not if I prove to you that I can make and keep custom?"</p>
            
            <p>"You can't expect $5 any place in town. You see, you are green; you don't
               know anything about the business."
            </p>
            
            <p>"The goods are all marked, arn't they? Well, I know enough about mathematics
               to master the intricacies of your check and stub in ten minutes, and I must
               have work right off with enough salary to live on."
            </p>
            
            <p>He put his foot on a chair and with a show of genuine interest wanted to know
               what it cost me to live. As I gave him the figures borrowed from a girl in
               J. S.'s employ he took them down on a piece of paper:
            </p>
            
            
            <p>Lodgings ...............$1 50 Car-fare................ 60
               Lunches................. 30
            </p>
            
            <p>That makes $2.40, and if you pay me $4 I will have $1.60 a week to live on.
               Perhaps you can tell me where a girl can get food and clothes for that
               amount?"
            </p>
            
            <p>"No, I can't. But why don't you go to the factory and sew?"</p>
            
            <p>"Make shirts at 80 cents a dozen and cloth jackets at 25 cents each? One
               trial is enough. Now I am going to see what I can make clerking," and
               thanking him for his attention I withdrew. In the C. of P. the manager told
               me I would have to begin on small pay, $3 or so, till the season opened, and
               that I might come in the next morning and he would try me.
            </p>
            
            <p>At the F. Mr. M.'s lieutenant said the girls were off on their vacation, and
               he didn't think it would be right to put me in while they were away.
            </p>
            
            <p>"That doesn't matter. Their pay goes right on, and I will be willing to leave
               when the old hands come back." As I expected, the fish bit, and he told me
               with something of a sardonic glance that the vacations were "free," and that
               I had better try the box or cloak factory till September.
            </p>
            
            <p>At P.'s I was told to see Mr. E. P., who hired the help, and I sought him up
               six floors and down in the basement. He was inclined to repulse me because
               business was slow, but I importuned and finally we came to terms. I was to
               begin at once and to work six weeks for nothing. Think of it! Work from 8 a.
               m. to 6 p. m from August 1 to September 12 and get nothing.
            </p>
            
            <p>"But you get your experience," said Mr. P.</p>
            
            <p>"Any woman who cannot get it in one week won't get it in six."</p>
            
            <p>He told me not to be so sure of that, but I persisted that the 
               business required only a limited knowledge of reading words, figures, and
               human nature and that if I didn't sell goods I didn't want any pay. For the
               next five minutes I played the role of Gabriel and blew my own trumpet.
            </p>
            
            <p>"Well, it's just this way: You are an inexperienced hand and I'll have to put
               you through all the departments before you will be useful in the stock.
               That's the way I train all my new hands, and when they leave here they can
               always get good places. You can try it if you've a mind to, and at the end
               of that time I'll give you a good reference or a place in the house."
            </p>
            
            <p>"At how much."</p>
            
            <p>"Well that depends. If you sell $50 or $60 worth of goods in a day I'll be
               willing to pay you $4, and if you sell $150 worth you can have $8. But you
               see I don't really need any one just now, for there is mighty little money
               to be made this season."
            </p>
            
            <p>"Do all your girls have to go through the six weeks of probation?</p>
            
            <p>"All the new ones. Every one. That's our plan, for it gives us a chance to
               see what kind of material the applicant is made of."
            </p>
            
            <p>"Well, I'll try it. If I find I can't live on nothing longer than two weeks
               will you give me a letter?"
            </p>
            
            <p>"No, I can't say that. I can't recommend you unless you serve the full six
               weeks, because it wouldn't do you any good. I couldn't say anything about
               you except that you worked for me.
            </p>
            
            <p>"And if I am found faithful and efficient wouldn't you say so?"</p>
            
            <p>"No, I couldn't. It wouldn't do, don't you see, because I have a reputation
               for turning out the best kind of help."
            </p>
            
            <p>"Well?"</p>
            
            <p>In response to fatherly inquiry I told him I was staying with 
               friends, on whom I had only the claims of friendship, but that I had
               absolutely no resources beyond self-help. He spoke encouraging words about
               the rewards of industry and the face value of push, vim, and snap, and with
               so much fabric on which to rear hope - that trembling expectation of things
               far removed - I engaged.
            </p>
            
            <p>The first direction was to go down in the basement, and put my hat in the
               cloak-room. I saw plenty of men and girls in the dim gaslight selling goods
               at the various counters, and little boys running around with bundles and
               checks, but no evidence of any cloak-room.
            </p>
            
            <p>I asked a little tow-head and he pointed "over there." I pushed open the
               heavy black door that swung in and fear and horror seized me. The smell was
               sickening and the heat overpowering. The floor was wet and slippery and the
               place so dark that I could not see anything for a moment or so. The first
               door in the inclosure was marked "ladies' toilet," and I pushed it open to
               find even a more densely polluted atmosphere. The room was very large,
               divided by a partition, on one side of which was a small iron sink in which
               a large yellow bowl had been placed. There was a scrap of brown soap on the
               wet shelf, and near by hung a small looking-glass. A long crash towel
               drooped like a transferred sea-weed from a roller on the opposite side of
               the room. The next was a "gents' room," beyond which I found the cloak-room,
               a place so dark that I could not find a cubby-hole in which to stow my hat
               for some time. Like the annex, the floor was wet, the atmosphere foul, and
               the heat so intense that I thought my head would burst. The arrangement was
               of the usual order, each box being numbered and the inclusive numbers marked
               on the end of each tier. Notwithstanding the severity of my black chip hat I
               was not a little disinclined to lay it in the dusty, ashy hollow. But in it
               went and out I went, with my throbbing temples between my hands and my body
               streaming at every pore. On  my way out I discovered tbe blazing
               furnace along the west wall which gave the cloak and toilet rooms their
               tropical climate. On this floor there must have been at least fifty persons,
               separated from the enfeebling heat and vitiated atmosphere by a mere wooden
               partition. I asked a man behind a pile of cottonades how he stood it, and he
               said:
            </p>
            
            <p>"My God, a body can stand anything when he can't get bread for his children
               any other way. It's awful hard here these hot days, but we don't mind it in
               cool weather."
            </p>
            
            <p>Although I felt as though I had been sick and was convalescing the hot-air
               bath did me good, for when I stepped from the elevator into the bright
               sunlight and free air of the main floor I was as happy and light-hearted as
               a nymph in fairyland. Mr. P. met me and escorted me to the running-stock,
               placed on narrow counters running the whole length of the aisle. There were
               buttons at five cents a card, one trough full of penny handkerchiefs, and
               another at three cents each. A little farther along was a medley of ruchings
               dirt cheap, a sea of fifteen cent aprons with tucks and shirrings, and a
               fine line of cuffs and collars a nickel apiece. Midway were the toilet
               specials - Florida waters, bay rum, foreign and domestic colognes from five
               cents to forty cents a bottle, and a mountain of medicated paper rising from
               a bed of swans-down face powder, pink and white, only seven cents a box. Mr.
               P. told me to "take hold of the whole lot and sell anything I could." I took
               hold of the toilet waters and medicated paper, and the floor-walker brought
               me a book and showed me how to make out a check. I had only committed to
               memory the cologne stock—violet, lavender, anemonee, and queen—when a
               strange man from the other aisle called : "Hist there, come and wait on this
               lady." He led me to the lawn counter, where a lady wanted to see some "buff
               swiss." All the clerks were measur- ing off nainsook, bombazine, or
               cross-bar lawn and could not heed my application for "buff swiss." I read
               all the box la-  bels. Not one bore the Alpine legend. Presently
               my male confrere advised me and I pulled out a box, hit my nose with the off
               corner, and raised a dust when I dropped the heavy pasteboard on the
               counter. The box was full of white swiss, and the lady said it wouldn't do.
               I smiled and asked if she wanted to match.
            </p>
            
            <p>"No; for a picnic hat."</p>
            
            <p>I told her she wanted tarlatan, and that I had a lovely shade. I showed it to
               her.
            </p>
            
            <p>"Won't do"</p>
            
            <p>"But it gathers beautifully and is very becoming to your complexion," putting
               the stuff alongside her amber cheek. "Just get some black wings or a bunch
               of purple pansies to go with it and you will have a regular fete hat."
            </p>
            
            <p>She succumbed and took half a yard—ten cents' worth. I borrowed my neighbor's
               scissors, and as I cut off the amount I could not but think that my first
               customer got a good deal out of me and Mr. P. for her money. When I made out
               the check and gave it to the man on my right to "please run," I went back to
               my perfumes, papers and powders. For the next few hours I did a rushing
               business with the one-cent handkerchiefs, which I boomed to the roof. I sold
               them to small boys and old men, to visiting gentlemen and ladies, and to
               scores of young mothers carrying babes in their arms. When I was thinking it
               was about time for some one to come and pour the oil of gladness on my head
               I learned that the handkerchiefs were a specialty and limited to two. I had
               been selling them in lots of from six to ten, and fearing the consequences I
               sneaked down to the aprons and endeavored to make a customer of every man,
               woman and child that came my way. A lady came along for two 3-cent
               handkerchiefs and while waiting for the change I showed her some German
               cologne. I noticed when I was removing the stopper to give her a smell that
               the vial was marked 40 cents, but as the large display card read  "35 cents each" I concluded the fragrant stuff had been reduced and told
               her so. While I was stating the fact the floor-walker came along and told me
               I was mistaken. "There's the price plainly marked 40 cents, madame, and its
               a bargain."
            </p>
            
            <p>"No, I won't pay but thirty-five cents, that's what this girl told me," and
               the gentleman said take it along. When I had run the check and the lady had
               gone, he came back and blew me up, as a bit of a girl in the tidies said he
               would. He asked me what the matter was; if I hadn't "better soak my head and
               learn to read," and wanted to know where I had been "hanging out." I suppose
               the proper thing would have been to cry. but I only yawned and said I wished
               there were chairs for the clerks to sit down when they were tired. Then I
               was told to take and mark these queen colognes forty cents.
            </p>
            
            <p>"Does the firm provide lead pencils?" I asked.</p>
            
            <p>"Yes, and gold watches."</p>
            
            <p>"Where shall I go to get a pencil; I have none?"</p>
            
            <p>"All you get here will go in your eye," and the elegant overseer left me. A
               girl who heard the talk said I could go down to the stationery counter and
               buy one for two cents.
            </p>
            
            <p>At noon Mr. P-- came along and told me he had been watching me and that I
               would make a first-class clerk in time. "You have the ambition and that's
               what we want. Did you bring your lunch?"
            </p>
            
            <p>"No sir."</p>
            
            <p>"Well you can just go up to the lunch room and get your dinner. I'll pay for
               it. Only twenty minutes noon today."
            </p>
            
            <p>I thanked him and rode up to the sixth floor. The place was an immensity of
               space, partially occupied with boxed goods. In one small corner a small boy
               had charge of a large table about which were upholstery and way down a
               hundred feet or more, sat a young woman sewing brussels carpet. Her face was
               unforgetably sad and her form slight and stooped.
            </p>
            
            <p>"I don't mind being up here alone," she said. "I prefer  it to
               the crowd down on the other floors. I get very tired and would rather work
               five hours longer at this than stand on my feet from eight to six. I get
               five dollars a week. I have been here going on two years. It's a nice house
               to work for because they never fine you, and Mr. P-- always takes the girls'
               part when the boys are insulting."
            </p>
            
            <p>In the center of the great roomy floor was an old piano, and as soon as the
               girls ate their lunch there was music and song and a whirl or so about the
               dusty floor. You pert young ladies and insolent old women who think it
               necessary to abuse and brow-beat these brave little bread-winners would be
               ashamed of yourselves could you hear the melody their fingers extract from
               the disabled instrument, and remember the money wasted on your musical
               education. They not only played with grace and filing, but they sung and
               danced and talked about books and magazines borrowed from the libraries - a
               proof conclusive that "oft in a wooden house a golden room we find."
            </p>
            
            <p>In and about this playroom of shop girls I saw many sweet things that were
               more than human. The big girls took a motherly interest in the little clerks
               and told them how to "treat the customers" and how to "get along with the
               walkers." One gentle creature with "odd" shoes on gave a little
               freckle-faced girl of twelve years, whose hair she was combing this
               lecture:
            </p>
            
            <p>"Now, you mustn't get sassy."</p>
            
            <p>"I'll sass them if they sass me," retorted the child with a storm of
               tears.
            </p>
            
            <p>"No, no. Now, don't you cry," and she put her arms about the little one and
               loved her as tenderly as if she were a daughter.
            </p>
            
            <p>"It isn't any matter what a lady says to you. You musn't pay any attention to
               it. But if you say anything back she'll report you and "E' ll" discharge
               you. I tell you how I do.  When a customer treats me bad I go
               away from her and fix the stock. Just try it next time. Mercy, how fast your
               bang is growing; I'll have to trim it again."
            </p>
            
            <p>I saw a girl pay 3 cents for a cup of tea, pour out a saucerful for herself
               and give the rest to her shabby chum who wasn't feeling well. Ever so many
               gave a bite of pie or tart to a friend who had no desert, and a slim girl
               named Mary, in the fringe-stock, spent her entire noon with a friend sewing
               the gathers in a skirt that had been caught in the elevator latch. The girl
               with the injured gown stood up and fed her benefactor mouthfuls of bread and
               meat and raisins between the stitches. When the rent was mended the girls
               wiped their face and hands in their lunch-papers, because there was not time
               to go down to the basement just then, although there is no restriction to
               their leaving stock any time during the day.
            </p>
            
            <p>I had a dinner which an income of $5 or less per week would doubtless have
               made a real banquet. It was spread on a leather-covered table and seasoned
               with pepper and Worcester sauce, vinegar, etc. The spoon was tin and the
               bowl almost as shallow as the handle, and the parting between the two prongs
               of my fork was less than an inch long. I had a black, wood- handled knife
               with either edge of which I found it impossible to divorce my roast veal. A
               lithe little colored girl, as straight as a reed, served me with cucumbers,
               cold-slaw, mashed potatoes, green peas,melons and coffee, but the best to my
               liking was a dish of nice bread and butter. The colored woman who kept the
               kitchen told me she charged 20 cents for dinner, but not more than 10 clerks
               bought it. They couldn't afford to pay that much and she couldn't afford to
               sell it for less. Nearly all the hands brought their own lunches, and she
               served them with tea, coffee, milk or lemonade for 3 cents.
            </p>
            
            <p>"No, I don't pay anything for the kitchen. Mr. P. lets me have it rent free,
               just to help his clerks to be comfortable. He's a right good boss."
            </p>
            
            
            <p>A girl whom I interviewed on the subject said she liked the dinner well
               enough, but would rather take a walk at noon. "I often bring my lunch and
               eat it and then go out on State street."
            </p>
            
            <p>"Where?"</p>
            
            <p>"Well, I'll tell you, but you musn't think I'm crazy, because I ain't.
               Sometimes when I want anything I go to other stores and make the clerks wait
               on me. If I have any money and see what I like I take it, but if I havn't I
               say it won't do. Then I go to another shop and look for something else, and
               I keep on shopping for nothing till the time is up."
            </p>
            
            <p>"What for? To get rested? We havn't any seats in stock. There are benches up
               in the lunch-room, but it's no change to get up there. Anyhow, there's no
               place downtown here where girls can go unless it's up to the public library,
               and then all the seats are full. I'd go to the park front if it wasn't so
               far, but with that walk and only forty-five minutes. there's not much time
               to rest. Me and another girl used to go into the restaurants that were
               crowded and sit at the table. Often the waiters were so busy they'd never
               come near us till it was time to go. If they did hand us a bill of fare we'd
               pretend to be looking for something and he'd tell us to select what we
               wanted and go to wait on some other customer. Then we'd leave.
            </p>
            
            <p>"Now we have a good scheme, but you musn't give it away. When we eat our
               lunch we go over to Field's or Gossage's and wash in the customers' room.
               It's awfully nice there, for they have white soap and clean towels and
               mirrors all along the walls. They don't know but we're customers, 'cause we
               price some goods first. We have towels here three times a day, but there's
               so many girls to dry on them that if you don't get down just as they're put
               up they are as wet as water.
            </p>
            
            <p>"How much do I get? Oh, I'll not tell."</p>
            
            <p>"One dollar a day?"</p>
            
            <p>"Not much."</p>
            
            
            <p>"How long have you been clerking?"</p>
            
            <p>"Three years."</p>
            
            <p>From 12:30 till 3 p. m. I was so busy I didn't have time to think. Every
               woman wanted to be waited on at once, and as soon as I put one bill of goods
               in the railroad basket the floor- walker clapped his hands and hustled me
               off to another. The result was I got flurried and couldn't tell the woman
               who had bought buttons and given me 25 cents from the one to whom the
               handkerchiefs at 17 cents even belonged. I couldn't work the baskets very
               well and for a time I had to hold the steel rim between my teeth while I put
               the check and change in the leather box in order to keep the basket from
               flying up above my head. It was like drawing a bucket of water out of a
               country well to get the goods up to the gallery, and almost as hard to pull
               the package and change down again. Little boys had charge of this part of
               the business, but they were neither numerous nor expeditious and a great
               amount of time intervened between a sale and the receipt of the money and
               parcel, in consequence of which the customers grew impatient and scolded the
               clerks and the clerks looked indifferent and said nothing. I pasted the raw
               skin on my hands that the ropes had worn to the quick and apologized, but
               neither availed much. I found the women customers insolent, overbearing,
               inconsiderate and very curt. But I bore with them, flattered them, humored
               them, tossed whole boxes of goods on the counter for their inspection, and
               literally forced them to buy. Of the dozens and dozens of women I approached
               with my "something I can show you" only two declined my services with
               thanks. The average woman told me she had been waited on, the fashionable
               dame said "no," and the ultras didn't answer at all.
            </p>
            
            <p>At three o'clock I was so tired that I was tempted to go home. My ruche had
               wilted to a mere thread, my hands were black from handling the rope and the
               stock, there was not a  clean spot on my handkerchief in which
               to wipe my perspiring face, and I had no place to sit and nothing to lean
               against. All the girls wore aprons with a large pocket in which they carried
               their check-book. I had no apron and no pocket large enough for the thick
               book. For a time I kept the clumsy volume on one of my seven counters, but
               the walker told me he had "caught on" and commanded me under penalty not to
               leave it lying there. The only place I could carry it was up under the front
               of my basque and up it was squeezed. Now that basque fits me within an inch
               of respiration, and whenever I squeezed the book up I had to gasp for
               breath. If I hadn't taken it out as often as I did there Is no telling how I
               should have survived. As it was I was almost ready to shut myself up like a
               jack-knife from the pain in my chest.
            </p>
            
            <p>And my feet! How they swelled. I expected every minute to see the buttons of
               my boots fly off and the uppers go to pieces. I stopped to look at them and
               a girl came and sympathized with me.
            </p>
            
            <p>"It's too bad you're not in stock," she said, "you could slip your feet out
               of your shoes. That's the way the girls do behind the counter, but of course
               you can't do that out here on the floor. But you'll get used to it. My feat
               swelled awful the first two weeks, but now I don't notice them at all. Lots
               of the girls wear slippers behind the counter." I took particular pains to
               investigate, and counted nine girls with one foot slipped out of their
               shoes. One girl stood in her stocking feet and ever so many had on one
               slipper or a pair of old shoes.
            </p>
            
            <p>Mr. P-- treated me very nicely. Besides giving me a free lunch he gave me a
               white poppy which I wore in my corsage all afternoon and he told me I was
               getting on finely. He showed me some of the goods he was particularly
               anxious to sell off and said I would get a "p. m." on each sale. Inasmuch as
               I had no other prospect prior to September twelfth, I set to work and sold a
               seventy-five cent imitation Turkish  chair-scarf and was given a
               ten-cent p. m. That paid my carfare. I learned that plenty of the girls had
               earned various sums in this way. And received one dollar p. m. on a lace
               counterpane, another twenty-five cents on a French plastron, and the girl in
               the silk stock was literally coining commissions. At five o'clock I waylaid
               Mr. E. and begged for a transfer.
            </p>
            
            <p>"Why?"</p>
            
            <p>"Well, I'm tired. I would like to try hosiery or parasols or flannels," I
               told him, for the real truth was I fancied something less prominent. I
               wanted to get off in a corner or down cellar away from a possible
               acquaintance. He promised to look about and returned shortly to "fetch me to
               the glove department. It's in charge of a very nice young fellow and perhaps
               you can marry him." Admitting that that was the height of my ambition, I
               followed and was presented to Mr. L., a very nice-looking gentleman and much
               nicer than he looked. He bowed with the grace of a Burr and remarked, "You
               havn't had any experience."
            </p>
            
            <p>"Oh yes, I have been in the employ of Mr. P. all day."</p>
            
            <p>"Well," with a little ha, ha "I'll try you at the twenty- five cent glove.
               Right in there." Right in there was not much wider than the extremes of a
               tom cat's whiskers, but I squeezed in, dislocating my bustle and Psyche knot
               and found myself at the very entrance of the big front door. There was
               nothing to do but put my pride in my pocket and saw wood, and I set about
               selling out before closing up. It was a good day for silk mitts and they
               sold like hot cakes. I did a rushing business and had the head of the
               department railroading my checks.
            </p>
            
            <p>I had sold about six pairs when he came over and told me I was a bully
               clerk.
            </p>
            
            <p>"I'll have to keep you here. Tell Mr. P. to hire some other girl."</p>
            
            
            <p>"Thank you, but I don't think I hanker to stay."</p>
            
            <p>"Why?"</p>
            
            <p>"The pay doesn't suit for the work expected of me."</p>
            
            <p>"How much are you getting?"</p>
            
            <p>"Nothing for six weeks."</p>
            
            <p>"Oh, no you are not."</p>
            
            <p>"I beg your pardon."</p>
            
            <p>"Nothing! No pay for six weeks?"</p>
            
            <p>"Those are the terms on which Mr. P. engaged me."</p>
            
            <p>"How much do you want to come in this stock and sell my goods?"</p>
            
            <p>"Couldn't be hired under ten dollars a week and want a raise when the season
               opens."
            </p>
            
            <p>"You shall have it. Come around in the morning - eight o'clock - and I'll go
               through the stock with you. You can go home now.
            </p>
            
            <p>I told Mr. P. of my success and he congratulated me and said:</p>
            
            <p>"Just the sort of a girl we want. Anyone with pluck can get on."</p>
            
            <p>"For six weeks with nothing?"</p>
            
            <p>As I made my weary way to the elevator the girls were sweeping out and
               preparing to leave. In the toilet-room I found twenty of them or more
               washing at the one small sink and drying their faces and hands in pocket
               handkerchiefs and petticoats. There were three towels on the rollers but
               they dripped.
            </p>
            
            <p>A few had powder rags and made up because there was no more convenient way of
               getting the dirt off.
            </p>
            
            <p>The only sign or rule in the entire establishment was the one posted in the
               lunch-room. It read: "Please take as little time as necessasy for lunch
               today."
