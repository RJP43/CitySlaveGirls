            <p>P. K. company! Pretty name, isn't it? Done in gens d'arm blue letters on a
               navy-blue ground it makes an exceedingly effective sign. The very colors
               suggest the claims of long descent and blue blood.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>But the P. company on West Washington street has nothing to do with blue
               blood or gentle women, and there is nothing pretty about it but the sweet
               young girls of fifteen and sixteen and the frail children of nine and ten
               whose lives are being wound about the great wooden bobbins, and from whose
               cheeks the roses of health and beauty are slowly absorbed by the flying
               threads in shuttle, needle, and spindle.
            </p>
            
            <p>P. K. company is only another name for the women's shirt factory at West
               Washington street. Up one flight of stairs I pass into a tidy little office
               where a fine looking gentleman gives me greeting and calls the forewoman,
               Mrs. M. She is young and pretty. Her voice is sweet and she has a good
               face.
            </p>
            
            <p>"Yes, I have work but it won't pay you. You can't live on the salary. I
               wouldn't advise you to take it. The table girls only get three dollars a
               week. Their work consists in sewing on buttons and finishing the armholes of
               the shirts. We have generally employed little girls of twelve and thirteen
               to do it. Better work pays by the piece, five and ten cents a dozen for
               knitting a finish about the neck and armholes and bottom of the shirts. But
               you would have to be experienced; we couldn't take the time to teach
               you."
            </p>
            
            <p>I told her I would try the table work until I could get something that paid
               better, as I was wholly dependent on my own
               resourses.
            </p>
            
            <p>"That's it, you see. I don't like to take you and have you leave as soon as
               you begin to be useful."
            </p>
            
            <p>"But I can't live on three dollars a week to save my soul, unless I subsist
               on cold water and wind and sleep with the birds."
            </p>
            
            <p>In as mild a manner as possible she told me that the P. K. company never
               meddled with the private affairs of its employes, and agreeing to promote me
               whenever a vacancy occured that I was able to fill. I started to fasten the
               tail ends of knitted  shirts at the munificent sum of fifty
               cents a day, or five cents an hour, work beginning at 7 a. m., and closing
               at 5:40 p. m. with thirty minutes for lunch. I paid five cents for a paper
               of sewing needles and five cents for a set of crochet needles before doing a
               stitch of work, so that at noon I had but fifteen cents to my credit.
            </p>
            
            <p>When the forewoman took me to the furnishing table I failed to see where she
               could put me. Down the long sides and across the ends were the girls, thirty
               or more, unpleasantly crowded, for the weather was hot, the room close, and
               the double row of shirts piled two and three feet deep intercepted any
               breeze that came in through the side windows. Beginning at one end she made
               the girls "shove up a little," and with this allowance from fifteen room
               enough was made for another chair to which I was assigned.
            </p>
            
            <p>The work was light, requiring but a few stitches at five or more places.
               Where the pattern was imperfect I had to crochet a couple of scallops,
               otherwise a few stitches with a zephyr needle sufficed. The slowest girl
               finished five dozen shirts a day, and some twice that number. A few at the
               board sewed on buttons and a regiment filed past with armfuls of shirts, in
               or ready to be put in boxes. We were so crowded that nearly every passer-by
               knocked me in the head with her elbow or load, while the girl at my left
               drew her needle under my very nose at each stitch. I could neither take up
               nor lay down my scissors without annoyance to the little girl on my
               right.
            </p>
            
            <p>I marveled as I looked at these girls that they should be permitted to labor
               as they did, ten hours a day in a dark, hot, room, exposed as they were to
               all manner of disease and the dangers of fire, for scarcely more wages than
               sufficed for food and car-fare. There was not a single attractive feature
               about their surroundings. The smoke from the engine had blackened the walls
               and the ceiling so that in the rear of the shop no calcimine was visible. At
               either end were two windows and  two more had been cut in the
               west wall, without supplying the needs of the round-shouldered workers, not
               a few of whom had defective sight.
            </p>
            
            <p>The distribution of a pair of closets and a brace of sinks in no way enhanced
               their value, for at noon-time the girls stood in line and waited for their
               turn to get near them. The sink at which I tried to fix my toilet was filled
               with dirty water, in which the little girls washed, drying on their own or a
               neighbors apron. There was a towel but it had exhausted its usefulness.
            </p>
            
            <p>The shirts were knitted by machines - thirteen or more little girls standing
               before the conical bobbins simply to keep the threads from getting tangled.
               These children were on their feet all day and at noon they sat on the floor
               and ate their lunches, leaning against the straps and legs of the knitters.
               Whatever these girls may have been in years - in face, form, size and
               strength they were little more than infants.
            </p>
            
            <p>Pale? Yes; bleached by confinement and thin as reeds from loss of sleep, loss
               of sunshine, of pure air, of wholesome food, and of play. Many of them had
               to be up at five o'clock in the morning, and all at six to get to the shop
               by seven. In return for their service they are paid three dollars a week, or
               five cents an hour. Poor indeed is the home that must depend on such a mean
               compensation for all that is lost to the child - health, vigor, youth.
            </p>
            
            <p>The machine-girls who trimmed the little woolen glove-fitting shirts were
               paid by the piece, most of them earning seventy-five cents a day and a few
               one dollar. So far as I could learn all the hands lived at home and each was
               one of a large family. They were mostly of foreign extraction, but not a few
               American families were represented by little sisters or daughters who were
               working for five and ten cents an hour to buy ribbons and theater tickets.
               To be just, they were in the minority; the vast army of youthful martyrs
               worked that  younger brothers and sisters might have bread and
               shoes and a shelter.
            </p>
            
            <p>Here is some of the talk I overheard :</p>
            
            <p>"How are you feeling, Maggie?"</p>
            
            <p>"I'm terribly sick, I can tell you. I slept with plasters on my feet, and I
               havn't sat down all morning. My mother told me to come home this noon if
               they kept me running and I didn't feel well. No, I guess I'll try and stay.
               I'm savin' up for a cloak and have only four dollars so far."
            </p>
            
            <p>Another child: "Didn't have hardly no lunch 'cause it was six when mother
               called me, and I eat my breakfus with her buttnin' my clothes, and shoved
               what I could in my box. There's no butter on this, and I didn't get no meat,
               but I don't care, mother's goin' to make me pancakes tonight."
            </p>
            
            <p>Still another wished "they'd permote" her, because she had had nothing to
               wear since the rent was raised. The evening before they "went for chips and
               got loads of blocks from the pavement."
            </p>
            
            <p>Hanging about were the usual rules and regulations relative to punctuality
               and property. One requiring that a three-days' notice preparatory to
               leaving, under penalty of forfeiting a week's salary, had greater prominence
               than the rest.
