"Do you want to visit a manufacturing establishment, generally held in high repute, where a girl's tenure of place depends
upon the degrading concessions she may be induced to make
to her employer?"
The question was put to a reporter for the Times by Inspector
G. R. of the health department. They had just formed a
temporary copartnership under the name and style of "we"
to make a thorough examination of the hells and holes where
human beings hive, delve, and thrive or die under the guise of
"employes."
"Well, I'll tell you the story and I know it to be true, and
so does my wife. A girl of good development and modest
demeanor had for some time been employed in book-bindery
and had become fairly well skilled. One afternoon she turned
in, as the result of her day's work, four books. The foreman
complained that the work was imperfect - in fact, that the
books were spoiled, and told the girl she must pay for them.
She asked for particulars but could get little satisfaction. She
became indignant and was thrust aside. Remembering that
other mouths than hers were awaiting the food her scanty
earnings must purchase she pleaded first for justice and then
for mercy.
"'You quit work with the rest at 6 o'clock,' said the foreman. 'Come back fifteen minutes later and perhaps I may

straighten out your account so that you will lose nothing'
The girl, hesitating between hope and fear, crossed the bridge
as if to go homeward, and then returned to the office. The
foreman was at the door, welcomed her within, and turned the
key. He assured her he had helped many of the girls in the
employ of the firm to balance their accounts after business
hours. Be that as it may, he had made a grave miscalculation
in this case, and in less seconds than it takes to tell it he was
glad he hadn't lost the key to the door. The girl came directly
to my house, told her story, and never returned to the tiger's
lair. Her case is but one of many, and if she adheres to her
present decision it will be the particular one of the many before the firm and the foreman hear the last of it. Now come
with me and we'll take a trip through the binderies and printing establishments, and before we get through I'll show you
the fiend who endeavored to ruin this young girl."
Our first visit of inspection was made to the five-story and
basement building, on Monroe street, occupied by the J. M.
company, printers, binders and lithographers. On the main
floor the superintendent gave us yellow tickets, each guaranteeing a single ride in a freight elevator at the rear to the fifth
floor. "You must walk down," he added, encouragingly.
To the fifth floor we went, and to all appearance arrived unannounced as the foreman was frank. A girl acknowledged she
was but 14 years old and worked ten hours a day, and the
closets were in bad condition. Groping our way down a dark
and narrow stairway, we learned that the foreman had been
called to the office.
"How old are you?" asked the inspector of a boy feeding a press.
"Seventeen," he replied, winking at a companion when the
inspector's back was turned, as much as to say he knew his
business. Apparently he was about 13, and probably that was
his age, as it was admitted that four boys and two girls under
legal age were regularly employed.

Save as to ill-kept closets on the three upper floors and a
scarcity even of that undesirable kind, the sanitary condition
of the premises is fair, light and ventilation being abundant.
Of the 305 employes 220 are males and eighty-five are females.
The wages of the latter range from $3 to $10 a week, averaging about $5, and the male average is $12.50.
"Aren't you from The Times?" asked one of the forewomen in a quizzical way.
"Do I look like a woman?"
"You might be 'Nell Nelson' disguised in pants for all I
know. But I don't care if you are; I'll tell you all I know."
"Facilis descensus avemi" doesn't apply to going downstairs in this factory, because it isn't easy to get down, and the
lower you get - that is to say, the nearer you approach the
manager's desk - the more heavenly the situation. Ceilings
rise in gradation and stairways expand until Mr. M's handsome office is reached.
"The health department claims that there should be one
closet for every twenty employes," said the inspector.
"But ours are only for use in case of emergency," replied
Mr. M. "We didn't put them in for the accommodation of
our help, and they are not expected to visit them during working hours; their time belongs to us. It is work that we want
from them."
This was said partly in self-defense and partly in repartee,
but even with apologetic explanation it grates harshly on the
ear. By an expenditure of a few hundred dollars, the health,
safety and comfort of 300 persons employed by a firm having
hundreds of thousands of dollars invested could be assured.
And at the same time it must be admitted that this is one of
the very best regulated establishments of the kind in Chicago.
The story told by the inspector did not relate to the J. M.
company.
